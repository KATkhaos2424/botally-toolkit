524425537369174017,2014-10-21 05:02:46,the rattle of wheels on the pavement as the farm horses plod home;
524425460776964097,2014-10-21 05:02:27,with my sewing by the table.  I think of Jinny; of Rhoda; and hear
523309023979139072,2014-10-18 03:06:08,and the lamps are lit they make a yellow fire in the ivy.  I sit

496868521633005569,2014-08-06 04:01:01,Colour returns.  The day waves yellow with all its crops.  The
496868269916045313,2014-08-06 04:00:01,starkness of the dawn is going out of it.  Now the day stirs.
494332310695579650,2014-07-30 04:03:01,grows gradually larger as it comes along the road.  The sheep

439928576968634368,2014-03-02 01:02:00,flowers in one garland and clasp them and present them--Oh! to
439928327269150721,2014-03-02 01:01:01,beams of their own watery light.  I will pick flowers; I will bind

439837985735856128,2014-03-01 19:02:02,and lay them on the desk's shiny surface.  I will sit by the

439626339566354432,2014-03-01 05:01:01,the passage rather shivering.  Things seem paler.  I will go now

439264202620801024,2014-02-28 05:02:01,blows it down.  Even the sight of her vanishing down the corridor

437663652447924224,2014-02-23 19:02:00,long skirts.  I shall wear necklaces and a white dress without

437089370491727872,2014-02-22 05:00:01,without divisions.  When I wake early--and the birds wake me--I lie
437029712011853824,2014-02-22 01:02:57,for the day to come.  I long that the week should be all one day

436727233886289920,2014-02-21 05:01:01,doves and my squirrel.  I shall go to the kennel and comb my

435640321557680128,2014-02-18 05:02:01,great horses of the phantom riders will thunder behind me and stop
435640070574329856,2014-02-18 05:01:01,myself out by the kitchen door.  I shall walk on the moor.  The
