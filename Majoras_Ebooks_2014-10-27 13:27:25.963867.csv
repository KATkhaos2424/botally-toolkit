526555931438358528,2014-10-27 02:08:11,"Look, I'd like you to buy my bomb, too, but it's just too heavy for you to carry. Sorry."
526540809026297856,2014-10-27 01:08:06,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
526525725059211264,2014-10-27 00:08:09,"Somebody! Anybody!!! Goddess of Time, help us please! We need more time!"
526510648646062081,2014-10-26 23:08:15,Only Jim and us are supposed to know about that secret route...
526495467308212224,2014-10-26 22:07:55,Ruff! ...I'm here for my wife and child. There's no way I'll lose!
526480392866390016,2014-10-26 21:08:01,"With black roses etched into it, the Great Fairy's Sword is the most powerful of all blades."
526465277370703872,2014-10-26 20:07:58,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
526450172067196929,2014-10-26 19:07:56,"That's a Gekko. And it's pretty angry! It's pretty weak, too. It really shouldn't be making a fool of you."
526435072539234304,2014-10-26 18:07:56,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.
526419967739039744,2014-10-26 17:07:55,Those inssside... Our friendsss... Brrrriiiiinnnng them!
526404887630729217,2014-10-26 16:08:00,You got a Magic Jar! Your magic power is replenished!
526389802044649473,2014-10-26 15:08:03,"Ohh, how adorable! Let me tug on your long ears. If you study the way of the sword here, you'll get your bunny dirty, so put it away."
526374756090535936,2014-10-26 14:08:16,The prize is Gold Dust! This stuff is the highest quality available!
526359614053298176,2014-10-26 13:08:05,You put a Zora Egg in a bottle! It doesn't look very healthy. You'd better have someone examine it quick!
526344514529546240,2014-10-26 12:08:05,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
526329459742216193,2014-10-26 11:08:16,"You got Don Gero's Mask! It looks just like Don Gero, conductor of the frog choir!"
526314324122271744,2014-10-26 10:08:07,"This isn't ""members-only,"" so take that thing off. I kid you not!"
526299240943730688,2014-10-26 09:08:11,No using masks in the store because of past indiscretions!
526284146880962560,2014-10-26 08:08:13,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
526269058992189440,2014-10-26 07:08:15,"With black roses etched into it, the Great Fairy's Sword is the most powerful of all blades."
526253930213146624,2014-10-26 06:08:08,Your notes echoed far... but nothing happened.
526238850654281728,2014-10-26 05:08:13,"That's a Real Bombchu! It runs at you with its pack of explosives, so protect yourself or else!"
526223725310386177,2014-10-26 04:08:07,The horse seems to like this song.
526208754245582849,2014-10-26 03:08:38,Oh! A Goron! Do you live in the mountains? Why is Tatl with you? Why? Huh? Why?
526193604096585728,2014-10-26 02:08:26,"You're our bodyguard, Grasshopper, so all you have to do is practice hard!"
526178418539233281,2014-10-26 01:08:05,No way! No Scrubs!
526163391300108289,2014-10-26 00:08:22,This is a problem. You just can't come in and hang out in our room!
526148271639519232,2014-10-25 23:08:17,I'm sorry. We're totally booked with reservations. Please tell that to your mother.
526133081493606402,2014-10-25 22:07:56,"Certainly, he had far too many weaknesses to use my power."
526118006703677441,2014-10-25 21:08:02,"Suddenly, memories of Princess Zelda come rushing back to you..."
526102932886786048,2014-10-25 20:08:08,Will you buy one of Tingle's maps?
526087789830340609,2014-10-25 19:07:57,That ill-mannered troublemaker from the other day said he'd break my instruments...
526072692869328897,2014-10-25 18:07:58,"From now on, be more aware of birds when you're strolling down the road..."
526057589046390784,2014-10-25 17:07:57,"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?"
526042481201147906,2014-10-25 16:07:55,Buying two of the same thing won't do you any good.
526027389134860290,2014-10-25 15:07:57,"Oh, man! I didn't think you'd come over here."
526012352341102593,2014-10-25 14:08:12,You managed to figure out a code that only we know! Now that's something! I like you!
525997225390784514,2014-10-25 13:08:05,This is a problem. You just can't come in and hang out in our room!
525967067615223809,2014-10-25 11:08:15,"This melody, lingering on the edges of your mind, is a song of memories of Princess Zelda."
525936851635281920,2014-10-25 09:08:11,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
525921745136410624,2014-10-25 08:08:09,Thanks for helping last night. The cows are doing well thanks to you. And they're putting out a lot of milk!
525891530699972608,2014-10-25 06:08:06,Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon. Hurry... The four who are there... Bring them here...
525876467452751874,2014-10-25 05:08:14,You got the Fierce Deity's Mask! Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?
525861337339920384,2014-10-25 04:08:07,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
525846304295890945,2014-10-25 03:08:23,"Hey, you're kinda cool."
525831154381758464,2014-10-25 02:08:11,Ho! Ho! I hear it's gonna fall harder than the way my clumsy brother is always dropping our juggling balls!
525816026940719104,2014-10-25 01:08:04,"That melody's bogus, man!"
525800942130585602,2014-10-25 00:08:08,You too can master it! Seek out troubled individuals and lend an ear!
525785875293024257,2014-10-24 23:08:15,"I wanna be one when I grow up, too."
525770690222239745,2014-10-24 22:07:55,"You got the Bunny Hood! My, what long ears it has! Will the power of the wild spring forth?"
525755599443611649,2014-10-24 21:07:57,Will you stop staring and just open that door for me?!?
525740499458457600,2014-10-24 20:07:57,"Oh, man! I didn't think you'd come over here."
525725397170671617,2014-10-24 19:07:56,Oh no! The Great Fairy!
525710295906267136,2014-10-24 18:07:56,"You're not thinking I'm stealing your song, do you?"
525695197707898880,2014-10-24 17:07:56,Please enjoy the Carnival of Time.
525680101212438529,2014-10-24 16:07:57,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you or whatever."
525664997163032577,2014-10-24 15:07:56,"Do you already have bombs, the special product of the Gorons?"
525649965024944129,2014-10-24 14:08:12,I can tell you're not very used to your Deku Scrub body yet.
525634831288246272,2014-10-24 13:08:04,"This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy Racetrack, just like the sign says."
525619734276894720,2014-10-24 12:08:04,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
525604670245326848,2014-10-24 11:08:13,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
525589524416454656,2014-10-24 10:08:02,Oh... You've collected some nice masks!
525574454391218176,2014-10-24 09:08:09,No way! No Scrubs!
525559345874878464,2014-10-24 08:08:07,You found all the Stray Fairies! Quick! Take them to their fellow fairies of the same color!
525544279502897152,2014-10-24 07:08:15,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."
525529135955726336,2014-10-24 06:08:04,You traded the Moon's Tear for a Land Title Deed!
525514072226164737,2014-10-24 05:08:13,"Ahh, I wanna find a girlfriend and get married soon, too..."
525498950048940033,2014-10-24 04:08:07,"Look, I'd like you to buy my bomb, too, but it's just too heavy for you to carry. Sorry."
525483860889333760,2014-10-24 03:08:10,I can tell you're not very used to your Deku Scrub body yet.
525453670713159680,2014-10-24 01:08:12,"If you're gonna fall, then what's stoppin' ya, you monster?!"
525438642547093505,2014-10-24 00:08:29,"If you leave my mask out there, something terrible will happen!"
525423564392894464,2014-10-23 23:08:34,You got the Keaton Mask! This is Kafei's mask of memories.
525408348465020928,2014-10-23 22:08:06,"Oh my, what are you doing to my dogs? Put the dog down and step away from the kennel!"
525393227579682816,2014-10-23 21:08:01,"That's a Gekko. And it's pretty angry! It's pretty weak, too. It really shouldn't be making a fool of you."
525378158049382400,2014-10-23 20:08:08,"If you play that strange song backwards, you can slow the flow of time."
525363064410222593,2014-10-23 19:08:09,You caught a Big Poe in a bottle! This may lead to something good...
525347970355855361,2014-10-23 18:08:11,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
525332814397734912,2014-10-23 17:07:57,Don't tell me you don't know about the Deku Baba! Cut it down when it has extended its body and Deku Nuts or Sticks will come out.
525317707441246208,2014-10-23 16:07:56,Only Sakon can open it. The only way in is to wait for Sakon to arrive.
525302610660577280,2014-10-23 15:07:56,"I bet if you had a weapon that was strong enough, one shot from it could pierce right through this!"
525287561011286016,2014-10-23 14:08:08,"It's a Desbreko. Once it bites you, it's not gonna want to let go. I haaaate this thing!"
525272454415933440,2014-10-23 13:08:06,"Umm, Mommy... Don't go picking up bomb bags in the middle of the night anymore."
525257353172492288,2014-10-23 12:08:06,No using masks in the store because of past indiscretions!
525242301316993027,2014-10-23 11:08:17,You cannot proceed any further through time...
525227144683614208,2014-10-23 10:08:04,"Returning to Snowhead, are you? It's dangerous at night, so be especially careful."
525212077443411968,2014-10-23 09:08:11,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"
525181867868176384,2014-10-23 07:08:09,"With black roses etched into it, the Great Fairy's Sword is the most powerful of all blades."
525166742725607424,2014-10-23 06:08:03,W-What just happened?! Everything has... started over...
525151684960350211,2014-10-23 05:08:13,Those sideburns...Aren't you Darmani? You're supposed to be dead...but you're alive? What have you been doing?
525136551416590337,2014-10-23 04:08:05,What are you doing?!? Didn't your shield just get swallowed???
525121491428311040,2014-10-23 03:08:14,Night of the Final Day. 12 Hours Remain
525106411676499968,2014-10-23 02:08:19,"This is the room of Evan, the leader of the Zora Band, The Indigo-Go's."
525091253696737282,2014-10-23 01:08:05,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
525076171516436481,2014-10-23 00:08:09,"Oh, kind young one! Please find the fairies trapped in Great Bay Temple."
525061112878731264,2014-10-22 23:08:19,Whoa!!! Look at the time! You don't even have a single day left!
525045924653846529,2014-10-22 22:07:57,"Oh my, what are you doing to my dogs? Put the dog down and step away from the kennel!"
525030826589708288,2014-10-22 21:07:58,"I'm sure it was because he was always playing tricks, so nobody wanted to play with him."
525015727455993857,2014-10-22 20:07:58,Those inssside... Our friendsss... Brrrriiiiinnnng them!
525000617568116736,2014-10-22 19:07:55,"Do you already have bombs, the special product of the Gorons?"
524985525422133248,2014-10-22 18:07:57,You put a Zora Egg in a bottle! It doesn't look very healthy. You'd better have someone examine it quick!
524970422006075392,2014-10-22 17:07:56,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
524955331873353729,2014-10-22 16:07:58,"It's a White Boe... Just calm down and attack it! Yeah, yeah, yeah... There are just a lot of them, OK?"
524940238406184960,2014-10-22 15:08:00,The moon has gotten so large! Quick! Take refuge as far away from town as you can!
524925191780986880,2014-10-22 14:08:13,"100 steps north, 100 steps south, 100 steps east, 100 steps west. The spot at which those giants parted is right in the middle of this town."
524910070828515328,2014-10-22 13:08:07,Strange... Isn't it? Getting a letter from a missing person...
524894982826520577,2014-10-22 12:08:10,"Ahh, I wanna find a girlfriend and get married soon, too..."
524879902600744960,2014-10-22 11:08:15,"Pa-Pa-Pa-Paper, please!"
524864760668377089,2014-10-22 10:08:05,"That won't do you any good. Hee, hee."
524849683001114624,2014-10-22 09:08:10,It's true! Surely the great Darmani can do something about the blizzard that blows in from Snowhead.
524834593766006785,2014-10-22 08:08:12,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
524819494670053377,2014-10-22 07:08:12,"Oh, why do we have to play these stupid brats' little games? C'mon! Hurry up and find them already!"
524804363831631872,2014-10-22 06:08:05,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
524789301565861888,2014-10-22 05:08:14,"You're not thinking I'm stealing your song, do you?"
524774199454224384,2014-10-22 04:08:13,Sorry! Pretend you didn't hear that. My sister will get mad at me.
524743979300945920,2014-10-22 02:08:08,"You got the Bunny Hood! My, what long ears it has! Will the power of the wild spring forth?"
524728866187669504,2014-10-22 01:08:05,"That's a Real Bombchu! It runs at you with its pack of explosives, so protect yourself or else!"
524713803619909632,2014-10-22 00:08:14,"Oh, yeah...and, um... The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!"
524698762459901952,2014-10-21 23:08:28,"If you're going to Great Bay, your timing is great. You should leave here as quickly as you can!"
524683531138498560,2014-10-21 22:07:56,What's this? You've already saved up 5000 Rupees?!
524668495175241728,2014-10-21 21:08:11,Your notes echoed far... but nothing happened.
524653353175773184,2014-10-21 20:08:01,"What?! Don't you know about the Skullwalltula? ... Just don't touch it, all right?"
524638251630350336,2014-10-21 19:08:01,You got a Magic Jar! Your magic power is replenished!
524623157370437632,2014-10-21 18:08:02,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
524608112938852352,2014-10-21 17:08:15,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
524593033208020994,2014-10-21 16:08:20,"Are you, by chance, a boat cruise customer?"
524577991720837120,2014-10-21 15:08:34,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
524562862367186944,2014-10-21 14:08:26,It takes courage to come thieving in the Pirates' Fortress!
524547746645016576,2014-10-21 13:08:23,"Welcome, Link... Allow me to ease your weariness."
524532762829545472,2014-10-21 12:08:50,The horse seems to like this song.
524517591734157313,2014-10-21 11:08:33,What are you doing?!? Didn't your shield just get swallowed???
524502395548471296,2014-10-21 10:08:10,"Hey, you're kinda cool."

522343281644933120,2014-10-15 11:08:37,Well...could you see it? It already may be impossible to stop its descent...
522328126362103809,2014-10-15 10:08:24,"Oh, yeah...and, um... The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!"
522313012971966464,2014-10-15 09:08:21,Eh-hee-hee...You have the same smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods...
522297939364818944,2014-10-15 08:08:27,This is a problem. You just can't come in and hang out in our room!
522282818756304897,2014-10-15 07:08:22,"You got Don Gero's Mask! It looks just like Don Gero, conductor of the frog choir!"
522267724420898816,2014-10-15 06:08:23,Please enjoy the Carnival of Time.

522222514840154113,2014-10-15 03:08:44,"Oh my, what are you doing to my dogs? Put the dog down and step away from the kennel!"
522207375021727746,2014-10-15 02:08:35,"What's this? Green clothes... White fairy... Sir, could you, by chance, be a forest fairy?"
522192219227189248,2014-10-15 01:08:21,I don't need that weird mask!
522177167849828352,2014-10-15 00:08:33,"I am Dampe, the grave keeper, who watches over this graveyard. My face is frightening, but I am not a bad person!"
522162075343134721,2014-10-14 23:08:34,Aw! No way! You finally got me!
522146885469884416,2014-10-14 22:08:13,"Accepting this keepsake doesn't make much sense to you, but you should take it anyway."
522131767000457217,2014-10-14 21:08:08,I'll just teach you the beginning...
522116734203875328,2014-10-14 20:08:24,You traded for the Largest Quiver! Now you can now hold up to 50 arrows!
522101589654261761,2014-10-14 19:08:13,"Hey, Skull Kid, what if you gave that mask you're wearing back now?"
522086494131871744,2014-10-14 18:08:14,I'm sorry. We're totally booked with reservations. Please tell that to your mother.
522071376610340866,2014-10-14 17:08:10,"We offer our customers limited-run milk. Thus, we are a members-only establishment."
522056305112928257,2014-10-14 16:08:17,That's Romani's Mask. Only adult customers can get that mask.
522041182851829760,2014-10-14 15:08:11,This is a problem. You just can't come in and hang out in our room!

521950645767520256,2014-10-14 09:08:25,Will you stop staring and just open that door for me?!?
521935563004203008,2014-10-14 08:08:29,Open your ears and listen hard!
521920455041490944,2014-10-14 07:08:27,It's true! Surely the great Darmani can do something about the blizzard that blows in from Snowhead.
521905376854155264,2014-10-14 06:08:33,Thanks for helping last night. The cows are doing well thanks to you. And they're putting out a lot of milk!
521890259550756864,2014-10-14 05:08:28,Anju is already fleeing to Cremia's ranch.
521875157900488704,2014-10-14 04:08:28,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"

521844962564919298,2014-10-14 02:08:29,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
521829841474056192,2014-10-14 01:08:23,You traded for the Largest Quiver! Now you can now hold up to 50 arrows!
521814768210812928,2014-10-14 00:08:30,Eh-hee-hee...You have the same smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods...
521799685187461120,2014-10-13 23:08:34,"My son often used that mask to find mushrooms in the forest. Oh, how I long for those days."
521784490721415169,2014-10-13 22:08:11,Strange... Isn't it? Getting a letter from a missing person...
521769375179628544,2014-10-13 21:08:07,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
521754309491306496,2014-10-13 20:08:15,"It's Jo, second of the four ghost sisters. Aim when she appears. Hurry! There's no time!"
521739173300944896,2014-10-13 19:08:07,Hey...you don't have a bow. I can't sell you these! I kid you not!
521724098058002432,2014-10-13 18:08:12,"Yeah, he's back, big brother."
521708969648087040,2014-10-13 17:08:05,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
521693888000442370,2014-10-13 16:08:10,You put a Zora Egg in a bottle! It doesn't look very healthy. You'd better have someone examine it quick!
521678782856310784,2014-10-13 15:08:08,It takes courage to come thieving in the Pirates' Fortress!
521663753410990082,2014-10-13 14:08:25,That's Romani's Mask. Only adult customers can get that mask.
521648624346734592,2014-10-13 13:08:18,"No, no, daddy-o! That song doesn't sing to my heart, baby!"
521633532716666880,2014-10-13 12:08:20,"Accepting this keepsake doesn't make much sense to you, but you should take it anyway."
521618463828103169,2014-10-13 11:08:27,"You're our bodyguard, Grasshopper, so all you have to do is practice hard!"
521603316946456576,2014-10-13 10:08:16,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
521588232295694338,2014-10-13 09:08:19,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.
521573160940888065,2014-10-13 08:08:26,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
521558035601178625,2014-10-13 07:08:20,"You got the Bunny Hood! My, what long ears it has! Will the power of the wild spring forth?"
521542921984557057,2014-10-13 06:08:17,I tell you...Tingle is the very reincarnation of a fairy!

521497658725122048,2014-10-13 03:08:25,"Ah! That stone! You must hand it over to me! In exchange, I'll give you my spot here... Deku Flower included!"
521482576070856705,2014-10-13 02:08:29,"I wanna be one when I grow up, too."
521467422499291136,2014-10-13 01:08:16,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you, or whatever."
521452407914377216,2014-10-13 00:08:36,Shut up. I'm busy right now...
521437283338039296,2014-10-12 23:08:30,"If you play that strange song backwards, you can slow the flow of time."
521422102386077696,2014-10-12 22:08:11,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
521407005190152192,2014-10-12 21:08:11,"Ohh, how adorable! Let me tug on your long ears. If you study the way of the sword here, you'll get your bunny dirty, so put it away."
521391919033634816,2014-10-12 20:08:15,W-What just happened?! Everything has... started over...
521376794444722176,2014-10-12 19:08:09,I'm sorry. We're totally booked with reservations. Please tell that to your mother.
521361698234449920,2014-10-12 18:08:09,"Oh, yeah! How was it? It went by in an instant, right? I'm still full of energy!"
521346584521355265,2014-10-12 17:08:06,It looks like the lady is taking a break. Let's not bother her.
521331496661954560,2014-10-12 16:08:09,Whaaat?!? You're really gonna give me that much? You're one rich little guy!
521316387956875264,2014-10-12 15:08:07,Eh-hee-hee...You have the same smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods...

521286237961719808,2014-10-12 13:08:18,"Hey, Skull Kid, what if you gave that mask you're wearing back now?"
521271139176165376,2014-10-12 12:08:18,"You have strange powers, no? Me been watching you!"
521256066974113795,2014-10-12 11:08:25,"Is that so? Think it over, little guy!"
521225850637672449,2014-10-12 09:08:21,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"
521210771691163649,2014-10-12 08:08:26,Huh? When did you get that instrument?!?
521195884638257152,2014-10-12 07:09:16,Those inssside... Our friendsss... Brrrriiiiinnnng them!

521135372105838592,2014-10-12 03:08:49,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
521120285685071872,2014-10-12 02:08:52,Don't tell me you don't know about the Deku Baba! Cut it down when it has extended its body and Deku Nuts or Sticks will come out.
521105093832105986,2014-10-12 01:08:30,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
521090032526843904,2014-10-12 00:08:39,Will you stop staring and just open that door for me?!?
521074951747428353,2014-10-11 23:08:44,"Even if it's just out of pure stubbornness, I'm going to keep the shop going..."
521059738969067520,2014-10-11 22:08:17,Grrrr... We're the notorious Gorman Brothers! We can't get all sappy over stuff like this!
521044618574446592,2014-10-11 21:08:12,The horse seems to like this song.
521029525388292096,2014-10-11 20:08:13,It's a mystical song that allows you to shed a shell shaped in your current image.
521014416863555584,2014-10-11 19:08:11,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."

520969121425399809,2014-10-11 16:08:12,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
520954007632629760,2014-10-11 15:08:08,"OK, it's closing time. Quick! Get outta here!"
520938973665849344,2014-10-11 14:08:24,"Hey, Skull Kid! Do you realize what you've been doing to everyone?!?"
520923834606579712,2014-10-11 13:08:15,"We have all been expecting your next order, sir."
520908747804123136,2014-10-11 12:08:18,Hullo. Did ya come to buy a Powder Keg?
520893678596796416,2014-10-11 11:08:25,I can tell you're not very used to your Deku Scrub body yet.
520878544625229824,2014-10-11 10:08:17,"I hear some ghosts or something appeared at Romani Ranch yesterday, and now all their cows are gone."
520863450910584833,2014-10-11 09:08:18,Oh no! The Great Fairy!
520848364523364353,2014-10-11 08:08:21,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
520833252215377920,2014-10-11 07:08:18,"Accepting this keepsake doesn't make much sense to you, but you should take it anyway."
520818161516433408,2014-10-11 06:08:20,The drink even boosts your magic stamina! Swirl it around with your tongue to enjoy its flavor to the fullest!
520803083740147712,2014-10-11 05:08:25,Anju is already fleeing to Cremia's ranch.
520787951790211072,2014-10-11 04:08:18,"That won't do you any good. Hee, hee."
520772873871314946,2014-10-11 03:08:23,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
520757809072189441,2014-10-11 02:08:31,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
520742644209569792,2014-10-11 01:08:15,You did it! You helped Cremia! You feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Sigh... You could get used to this!
520727578055692290,2014-10-11 00:08:23,What's that?!? The Skull Kid got to Koume?!?
520712483820957696,2014-10-10 23:08:25,"I hear some ghosts or something appeared at Romani Ranch yesterday, and now all their cows are gone."

520682211075313664,2014-10-10 21:08:07,"You got Don Gero's Mask! It looks just like Don Gero, conductor of the frog choir!"
520667123387875328,2014-10-10 20:08:10,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
520651998136266752,2014-10-10 19:08:04,Ho! Ho! I hear it's gonna fall harder than the way my clumsy brother is always dropping our juggling balls!
520636927704190976,2014-10-10 18:08:11,You cannot proceed any further through time...
520621798799314944,2014-10-10 17:08:04,"If you're going to Great Bay, your timing is great. You should leave here as quickly as you can!"
520606718368030720,2014-10-10 16:08:08,"Ye who hold the sacred sword, leave proof of our encounter."
520591618286448640,2014-10-10 15:08:08,Have you been to the Clock Tower plaza yet?
520576577742979074,2014-10-10 14:08:22,Only Sakon can open it. The only way in is to wait for Sakon to arrive.
520561449685364736,2014-10-10 13:08:15,The ghosts of a hundred soldiers swear allegiance to this symbol of authority.
520546360588660737,2014-10-10 12:08:18,"Man, I just work here part-time, so I don't really know this stuff."
520531277624000512,2014-10-10 11:08:22,You managed to figure out a code that only we know! Now that's something! I like you!
520516160068923392,2014-10-10 10:08:17,I have a request! Kafei... I have a clue... that will help you find him.
520501060322856962,2014-10-10 09:08:17,"Why was the...? Why was the...? Why was the dog the leader?!? Was it 'cause something was wrong with me, sir???"
520485997591531520,2014-10-10 08:08:26,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
520470868183379968,2014-10-10 07:08:19,"I wanna be one when I grow up, too."
520455765509697536,2014-10-10 06:08:18,"And just between you and me, the Skull Kid is no match for the Great Fairy."
520440678598205442,2014-10-10 05:08:21,"It's a White Boe... Just calm down and attack it! Yeah, yeah, yeah... There are just a lot of them, OK?"

520380257937813505,2014-10-10 01:08:16,"Heyyy! You don't have that much! You shouldn't lie to people! And you can take that to the bank, mister!"
520365222410719232,2014-10-10 00:08:31,Oh! A Goron! Do you live in the mountains? Why is Tatl with you? Why? Huh? Why?
520350104889204736,2014-10-09 23:08:27,"Though you may not understand these grown-up matters, you should probably take the pendant to Anju, anyway."
520334935224098816,2014-10-09 22:08:10,What are you doing?!? Didn't your shield just get swallowed???
520304739905327104,2014-10-09 20:08:11,I'm terribly sorry. There are no vacancies today...We're booked solid with reservations.
520289624896192512,2014-10-09 19:08:07,"You can't use any of them, but feel free to look around."
520274542753640449,2014-10-09 18:08:11,I tell you...Tingle is the very reincarnation of a fairy!
520259416143056896,2014-10-09 17:08:05,Will you buy one of Tingle's maps?
520244326987620352,2014-10-09 16:08:07,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"
520229228847964161,2014-10-09 15:08:08,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
520214211285090306,2014-10-09 14:08:27,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
520199051409489921,2014-10-09 13:08:13,That ill-mannered troublemaker from the other day said he'd break my instruments...
520183971317968896,2014-10-09 12:08:17,"From now on, be more aware of birds when you're strolling down the road..."
520168894204366848,2014-10-09 11:08:23,"It's a Desbreko. Once it bites you, it's not gonna want to let go. I haaaate this thing!"
520153764909436928,2014-10-09 10:08:16,You caught a Big Poe in a bottle! This may lead to something good...
520138683567972352,2014-10-09 09:08:20,"But something has to be done about this cold. Otherwise, we'll be Goronsicles."
520123614893326336,2014-10-09 08:08:27,"Oh, man! I didn't think you'd come over here."
520108499112439809,2014-10-09 07:08:23,"If you leave my mask out there, something terrible will happen!"
520093378222886912,2014-10-09 06:08:18,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."
520078331392167937,2014-10-09 05:08:31,Well...could you see it? It already may be impossible to stop its descent...
520048181174738944,2014-10-09 03:08:43,Ruff! ...I'm here for my wife and child. There's no way I'll lose!
520033006380011521,2014-10-09 02:08:25,"My sister Romani has been worried, too. She's practicing using a bow... She says it's to stop the ""ghosts."""
520017916633174016,2014-10-09 01:08:27,"Hey, Skull Kid! Do you realize what you've been doing to everyone?!?"
520002839293071361,2014-10-09 00:08:32,Eh-hee-hee...You have the same smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods...
519987767225221120,2014-10-08 23:08:39,Don't tell me you don't know about the Deku Baba! Cut it down when it has extended its body and Deku Nuts or Sticks will come out.
519972602958196737,2014-10-08 22:08:23,Leeeaave me something small and creepy!
519957443229401088,2014-10-08 21:08:09,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
519942361904709632,2014-10-08 20:08:13,"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?"
519912153008971776,2014-10-08 18:08:11,Ho! Ho! I hear it's gonna fall harder than the way my clumsy brother is always dropping our juggling balls!
519897035265163265,2014-10-08 17:08:07,"This melody, lingering on the edges of your mind, is a song of memories of Princess Zelda."
519881946529153025,2014-10-08 16:08:09,"Ye who hold the sacred sword, leave proof of our encounter."
519866847865217024,2014-10-08 15:08:09,I tell you...Tingle is the very reincarnation of a fairy!
519851832391110657,2014-10-08 14:08:29,Ye who hold my remains... Return to the appointed place to face me...
519836698444693504,2014-10-08 13:08:21,Your notes echoed far... but nothing happened.
519821601034866688,2014-10-08 12:08:22,"You got Don Gero's Mask! It looks just like Don Gero, conductor of the frog choir!"
519806537749909504,2014-10-08 11:08:30,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
519791405242130433,2014-10-08 10:08:22,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
519776300223844354,2014-10-08 09:08:21,"Hey, you're kinda cool."
519761215795372032,2014-10-08 08:08:25,"You have strange powers, no? Me been watching you!"
519746101662859264,2014-10-08 07:08:21,Don't you have a mask that can summon the unseen?
519731014378078208,2014-10-08 06:08:24,"If you're going to Great Bay, your timing is great. You should leave here as quickly as you can!"
519715924828356608,2014-10-08 05:08:26,Please take refuge. We are fine here. We shall greet the morning... together.
519700834674679808,2014-10-08 04:08:29,"Huh? Do you mean you haven't been approved to carry Powder Kegs, yet?"
519685771205177347,2014-10-08 03:08:37,"Returning to Snowhead, are you? It's dangerous at night, so be especially careful."
519670665134100481,2014-10-08 02:08:36,"I hear some ghosts or something appeared at Romani Ranch yesterday, and now all their cows are gone."
519655492763660288,2014-10-08 01:08:18,"It's a White Boe... Just calm down and attack it! Yeah, yeah, yeah... There are just a lot of them, OK?"
519640420129599488,2014-10-08 00:08:25,"Are you, by chance, a boat cruise customer?"
519625363459039235,2014-10-07 23:08:35,What do you want? Don't look down at me! Adults shouldn't mess with kids' games!
519610182406377473,2014-10-07 22:08:16,"And just between you and me, the Skull Kid is no match for the Great Fairy."
519595075932672003,2014-10-07 21:08:14,"Oh, why do we have to play these stupid brats' little games? C'mon! Hurry up and find them already!"
519580006809219073,2014-10-07 20:08:21,"That's a Gekko. And it's pretty angry! It's pretty weak, too. It really shouldn't be making a fool of you."
519564856328871936,2014-10-07 19:08:09,"You got Don Gero's Mask! It looks just like Don Gero, conductor of the frog choir!"
519549765361487872,2014-10-07 18:08:11,"So, please, give me that which you promised me... Don't tell me... My mask... You did... get it back...Didn't you?"
519519556977430528,2014-10-07 16:08:09,We were about to punish an innocent monkey!
519504451141246976,2014-10-07 15:08:07,You caught a Big Poe in a bottle! This may lead to something good...
519489430218764288,2014-10-07 14:08:26,Bremor! Don't be standin' 'round lookin' at yer feet all day!
519474297987813377,2014-10-07 13:08:18,Whaaat?!? You're really gonna give me that much? You're one rich little guy!
519459206898790400,2014-10-07 12:08:20,Strange... Isn't it? Getting a letter from a missing person...
519444174764920833,2014-10-07 11:08:36,Those inssside... Our friendsss... Brrrriiiiinnnng them!
519429069960519680,2014-10-07 10:08:35,"Oh my, what are you doing to my dogs? Put the dog down and step away from the kennel!"
519414000526700544,2014-10-07 09:08:42,Only Jim and us are supposed to know about that secret route...
519398903821504512,2014-10-07 08:08:43,Those sideburns...Aren't you Darmani? You're supposed to be dead...but you're alive? What have you been doing?
519383843925536768,2014-10-07 07:08:52,Will you buy one of Tingle's maps?
519368712709611520,2014-10-07 06:08:45,"You got the Bremen Mask! This mask belonged to the leader  of the animal troupe. Try parading it around tiny, young animals."
519353668072509440,2014-10-07 05:08:58,But outside it seems to have gotten kind of...dangerous. Yikes... I'm gettin' outta town!
519338497207828481,2014-10-07 04:08:41,"I am Dampe, the grave keeper, who watches over this graveyard. My face is frightening, but I am not a bad person!"
519323397109448704,2014-10-07 03:08:41,"Is that so? Think it over, little guy!"
519308290757378048,2014-10-07 02:08:39,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
519293119238393857,2014-10-07 01:08:22,Ruff! ...I'm here for my wife and child. There's no way I'll lose!
519262986263728128,2014-10-06 23:08:38,"OK, it's closing time. Quick! Get outta here!"
519247774441668608,2014-10-06 22:08:11,"100 steps north, 100 steps south, 100 steps east, 100 steps west. The spot at which those giants parted is right in the middle of this town."
519232673181491200,2014-10-06 21:08:10,"No, no, daddy-o! That song doesn't sing to my heart, baby!"
519217590464290816,2014-10-06 20:08:14,"Oh, kind young one! Please find the fairies trapped in Great Bay Temple."
519202511161270272,2014-10-06 19:08:19,Oh no! The Great Fairy!
519187380842950656,2014-10-06 18:08:12,This is a problem. You just can't come in and hang out in our room!
519172253389303809,2014-10-06 17:08:05,Aw! No way! You finally got me!
519157183074676737,2014-10-06 16:08:12,What's that?!? The Skull Kid got to Koume?!?
519142081462161408,2014-10-06 15:08:12,"Ahh, I wanna find a girlfriend and get married soon, too..."
519127046698463233,2014-10-06 14:08:27,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
519111956876124160,2014-10-06 13:08:29,Bremor! Don't be standin' 'round lookin' at yer feet all day!
519096856584790016,2014-10-06 12:08:29,I'll never forget the days we spent together in Hyrule...
519081776107376642,2014-10-06 11:08:34,Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon. Hurry... The four who are there... Bring them here...
519066650432126976,2014-10-06 10:08:27,"Oh, yeah...and, um... The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!"
519051529693560833,2014-10-06 09:08:22,"Yeah, he's back, big brother."
519036479545147392,2014-10-06 08:08:34,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"
519021437735010305,2014-10-06 07:08:48,The mask that was stolen from me... It is called Majora's Mask.
519006253708623874,2014-10-06 06:08:28,Only Sakon can open it. The only way in is to wait for Sakon to arrive.
518991196455063552,2014-10-06 05:08:38,This is the Bombers' Notebook. It contains the words we live by! Read it over!
518976064165400576,2014-10-06 04:08:30,What are you doing?!? Didn't your shield just get swallowed???
518961021000507393,2014-10-06 03:08:43,"Oh, it was the fairy's light. In that case, it's just perfect."
518945868305534976,2014-10-06 02:08:31,"You're our bodyguard, Grasshopper, so all you have to do is practice hard!"
518930791787544576,2014-10-06 01:08:36,Oh! Darmani! I've been waiting impatiently for you.
518915664585568257,2014-10-06 00:08:30,"I am Dampe, the grave keeper, who watches over this graveyard. My face is frightening, but I am not a bad person!"
518900564256509952,2014-10-05 23:08:29,You got the Fierce Deity's Mask! Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?
518885409611190272,2014-10-05 22:08:16,"You're not thinking I'm stealing your song, do you?"
518870281620709376,2014-10-05 21:08:09,"My son often used that mask to find mushrooms in the forest. Oh, how I long for those days."
518855187918635008,2014-10-05 20:08:11,W-What just happened?! Everything has... started over...
518840060817338368,2014-10-05 19:08:04,Oh... You've collected some nice masks!
518824991576428545,2014-10-05 18:08:11,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you or whatever."
518809867142721536,2014-10-05 17:08:06,I tell you...Tingle is the very reincarnation of a fairy!
518794789051834368,2014-10-05 16:08:11,You did it! You helped Cremia! You feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Sigh... You could get used to this!
518779682842353665,2014-10-05 15:08:09,I'm sorry. We're totally booked with reservations. Please tell that to your mother.
518764640650534912,2014-10-05 14:08:23,It takes courage to come thieving in the Pirates' Fortress!
518749514694270977,2014-10-05 13:08:16,Will you stop staring and just open that door for me?!?
518734430702018562,2014-10-05 12:08:20,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
518719354834145281,2014-10-05 11:08:26,"This melody, lingering on the edges of your mind, is a song of memories of Princess Zelda."
518704232115879937,2014-10-05 10:08:20,"I must hurry! The guest arriving in the afternoon will come. Skip this, skip that!"
518689158710054912,2014-10-05 09:08:26,Your notes echoed far... but nothing happened.
518674058909462530,2014-10-05 08:08:26,But Deku Scrubs are supposed to like rain. At least one of us has reason to be happy...
518659027757068289,2014-10-05 07:08:43,You have just freed the innocent spirit that this dark mask had kept imprisoned within the body of evil Odolwa.
518628761827172353,2014-10-05 05:08:27,All right! The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!
518613651314339841,2014-10-05 04:08:24,"Umm, Mommy... Don't go picking up bomb bags in the middle of the night anymore."
518598552633618433,2014-10-05 03:08:24,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
518583502690721792,2014-10-05 02:08:36,Don't you have a mask that can summon the unseen?
518568344991981569,2014-10-05 01:08:22,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"
518553275688161282,2014-10-05 00:08:29,I entered to win some concert tickets... Don't ya have anything to deliver to me?
518538212579352576,2014-10-04 23:08:38,What are you doing?!? Didn't your shield just get swallowed???
518522998672740352,2014-10-04 22:08:11,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
518507888738701312,2014-10-04 21:08:08,"That's a Gekko. And it's pretty angry! It's pretty weak, too. It really shouldn't be making a fool of you."
518492808777195520,2014-10-04 20:08:13,"Accepting this keepsake doesn't make much sense to you, but you should take it anyway."
518477696326569984,2014-10-04 19:08:10,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
518462607552827392,2014-10-04 18:08:12,It's a Hiploop. Quickly dodge it if it charges at you. But can't you first do something about that mask it's wearing?
518447479721705472,2014-10-04 17:08:06,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
518432398355091456,2014-10-04 16:08:10,What's this? You've already saved up 5000 Rupees?!
518417292883800066,2014-10-04 15:08:09,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
518387135305367554,2014-10-04 13:08:18,Hey...you don't have a bow. I can't sell you these! I kid you not!
518372057164165122,2014-10-04 12:08:23,"It's a Desbreko. Once it bites you, it's not gonna want to let go. I haaaate this thing!"
518356972983169025,2014-10-04 11:08:27,Open your ears and listen hard!
518341835714875392,2014-10-04 10:08:18,Er... W-W-Whewwwould you like me to read you a story?
518326751387082752,2014-10-04 09:08:22,Grrrr... We're the notorious Gorman Brothers! We can't get all sappy over stuff like this!
518311665025024000,2014-10-04 08:08:25,Anju is already fleeing to Cremia's ranch.
518296554931617793,2014-10-04 07:08:22,You have just freed the innocent spirit that this dark mask had kept imprisoned within the body of evil Odolwa.
518281444536250371,2014-10-04 06:08:20,"Huh? Do you mean you haven't been approved to carry Powder Kegs, yet?"
518266352428011521,2014-10-04 05:08:22,"I'm sure it was because he was always playing tricks, so nobody wanted to play with him."
518251246335959040,2014-10-04 04:08:20,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
518236175702577152,2014-10-04 03:08:27,"You're our bodyguard, Grasshopper, so all you have to do is practice hard!"
518221118339952640,2014-10-04 02:08:37,"You got the Bremen Mask! This mask belonged to the leader  of the animal troupe. Try parading it around tiny, young animals."
518205945080320000,2014-10-04 01:08:19,"If you could somehow step on top of that Octorok, I bet you'd be able to climb onto that central pillar."
518191082450853888,2014-10-04 00:09:16,"Certainly, he had far too many weaknesses to use my power."
518175800244195328,2014-10-03 23:08:32,"Hey, Skull Kid, what if you gave that mask you're wearing back now?"
518160620659539968,2014-10-03 22:08:13,"Oh, kind young one! Please find the fairies trapped in Great Bay Temple."
518145509098151936,2014-10-03 21:08:10,And they say the world is a hard place. Look at you! I'd say you're pretty lucky!
518130418399182848,2014-10-03 20:08:12,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
518115297069264896,2014-10-03 19:08:07,"Zero Rupees? Oh, that's a cruel joke!"
518100244261650432,2014-10-03 18:08:18,H-h-hoooo...It's cold. This cold has me hallucinating about Darmani. I can't take it.
518085109367332864,2014-10-03 17:08:10,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
518070025484115968,2014-10-03 16:08:14,Return the flow of time to normal?
518054909195722754,2014-10-03 15:08:10,Ho! Ho! I hear it's gonna fall harder than the way my clumsy brother is always dropping our juggling balls!
518039879138017280,2014-10-03 14:08:26,Your defense has been strengthened! Enemies now do half as much damage as before!
518024757430587393,2014-10-03 13:08:21,I'll be on vacation for a short while. Please don't look for me.
518009670292631552,2014-10-03 12:08:24,"Umm, Mommy... Don't go picking up bomb bags in the middle of the night anymore."
517994592013000705,2014-10-03 11:08:29,"Returning to Snowhead, are you? It's dangerous at night, so be especially careful."
517964389312241664,2014-10-03 09:08:28,"That's a Gekko. And it's pretty angry! It's pretty weak, too. It really shouldn't be making a fool of you."
517949302367195137,2014-10-03 08:08:31,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you or whatever."
517934175773413376,2014-10-03 07:08:24,"Oh, sorry. That's too bad. In that case, let me hear a song written by you, baby!"
517919075335286786,2014-10-03 06:08:24,Night of the Final Day. 12 Hours Remain
517904037115486208,2014-10-03 05:08:39,"If you play that strange song backwards, you can slow the flow of time."
517888869564305408,2014-10-03 04:08:23,Hullo. Did ya come to buy a Powder Keg?
517873811203444736,2014-10-03 03:08:32,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
517858737785012224,2014-10-03 02:08:39,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
517843570003152896,2014-10-03 01:08:22,"You can't use any of them, but feel free to look around."
517828538452279297,2014-10-03 00:08:39,The prize is Gold Dust! This stuff is the highest quality available!
517813431596883969,2014-10-02 23:08:37,W-What just happened?! Everything has... started over...
517798244114386944,2014-10-02 22:08:16,"Look, I'd like you to buy my bomb, too, but it's just too heavy for you to carry. Sorry."
517783142363435008,2014-10-02 21:08:15,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
517768033406685184,2014-10-02 20:08:13,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
517752918955397120,2014-10-02 19:08:09,"Man, I just work here part-time, so I don't really know this stuff."
517737850544996354,2014-10-02 18:08:17,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
517722715604545536,2014-10-02 17:08:08,Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon. Hurry... The four who are there... Bring them here...
517707650444693505,2014-10-02 16:08:17,This is the Bombers' Notebook. It contains the words we live by! Read it over!
517692523297259521,2014-10-02 15:08:10,Huh? When did you get that instrument?!?
517677525279854592,2014-10-02 14:08:34,Ho! Ho! I hear it's gonna fall harder than the way my clumsy brother is always dropping our juggling balls!
517662398300180481,2014-10-02 13:08:28,"I'm sure it was because he was always playing tricks, so nobody wanted to play with him."
517647300567396353,2014-10-02 12:08:28,Those inssside... Our friendsss... Brrrriiiiinnnng them!
517632211441299457,2014-10-02 11:08:31,You got a Silver Rupee! It's worth 100 Rupees! You're pretty happy!
517617089712881664,2014-10-02 10:08:25,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
517586894498983936,2014-10-02 08:08:26,Anju is already fleeing to Cremia's ranch.
517571876546043905,2014-10-02 07:08:46,Sorry! Pretend you didn't hear that. My sister will get mad at me.
517556679416639489,2014-10-02 06:08:22,"You got Don Gero's Mask! It looks just like Don Gero, conductor of the frog choir!"
517541609819213824,2014-10-02 05:08:29,"Hey, guy! You haven't passed my test, so how do you know my secret code?"
517526489810468864,2014-10-02 04:08:25,Only Sakon can open it. The only way in is to wait for Sakon to arrive.
517511414164901888,2014-10-02 03:08:30,"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?"
517496361256636416,2014-10-02 02:08:41,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
517466127207653377,2014-10-02 00:08:33,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
517451026803064833,2014-10-01 23:08:33,It's a Hiploop. Quickly dodge it if it charges at you. But can't you first do something about that mask it's wearing?
517435855984545792,2014-10-01 22:08:16,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."
517420739037630465,2014-10-01 21:08:12,It's a mystical song that allows you to shed a shell shaped in your current image.
517405642089189377,2014-10-01 20:08:12,Huh? The moon? It's gotten bigger again. Th-this is bad...
517390532792684544,2014-10-01 19:08:10,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you or whatever."
517375471311257600,2014-10-01 18:08:19,Whaaat?!? You're really gonna give me that much? You're one rich little guy!
517360339067756545,2014-10-01 17:08:11,I hate it! I hate it! I wanna see it! I wanna see it! I wanna see the race!
517345261350166528,2014-10-01 16:08:16,"We offer our customers limited-run milk. Thus, we are a members-only establishment."
517330145556701186,2014-10-01 15:08:12,Don't tell me you don't know about the Deku Baba! Cut it down when it has extended its body and Deku Nuts or Sticks will come out.
517315130141319168,2014-10-01 14:08:32,The drink even boosts your magic stamina! Swirl it around with your tongue to enjoy its flavor to the fullest!
517284905793748992,2014-10-01 12:08:26,"If it's possible, put the scent in something and take it to the Magic Hags' Potion Shop."
517269824959819776,2014-10-01 11:08:31,You traded the Moon's Tear for a Land Title Deed!
517254697225158657,2014-10-01 10:08:24,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."
517239603904786432,2014-10-01 09:08:26,It takes courage to come thieving in the Pirates' Fortress!
517224514317332481,2014-10-01 08:08:28,"Do you already have bombs, the special product of the Gorons?"
517209394258268160,2014-10-01 07:08:23,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
517194299193057281,2014-10-01 06:08:24,"You're our bodyguard, Grasshopper, so all you have to do is practice hard!"
517179209853050881,2014-10-01 05:08:27,Grrrr... We're the notorious Gorman Brothers! We can't get all sappy over stuff like this!
517164097947705345,2014-10-01 04:08:24,That's Romani's Mask. Only adult customers can get that mask.
517149143655927808,2014-10-01 03:08:58,"Pa-Pa-Pa-Paper, please!"
517118872462188544,2014-10-01 01:08:41,"That's a Real Bombchu! It runs at you with its pack of explosives, so protect yourself or else!"
517103732241080321,2014-10-01 00:08:31,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you, or whatever."
517088625071104000,2014-09-30 23:08:29,Young one! Please hear my plea! I have been broken and shattered to pieces by the masked Skull Kid.
517073464780271617,2014-09-30 22:08:15,"OK, it's closing time. Quick! Get outta here!"
517058345153208320,2014-09-30 21:08:10,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
517043267674701824,2014-09-30 20:08:15,You traded for the Largest Quiver! Now you can now hold up to 50 arrows!
517028149037506560,2014-09-30 19:08:11,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
517013124885774336,2014-09-30 18:08:29,"You can't use any of them, but feel free to look around."
516997929626644480,2014-09-30 17:08:06,"If people hear the great pirates have lost the treasure they stole, we'll become the laughing stock!"
516982849988079616,2014-09-30 16:08:11,What are you doing?!? Didn't your shield just get swallowed???
516967751856816129,2014-09-30 15:08:11,You did it! You helped Cremia! You feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Sigh... You could get used to this!
516952720343703552,2014-09-30 14:08:27,Eh-hee-hee...You have the same smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods...
516937587919814657,2014-09-30 13:08:19,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."
516922510776889346,2014-09-30 12:08:25,"Somehow, I feel as if I am once again racing with my son..."
516907423638884352,2014-09-30 11:08:28,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
516892308302622720,2014-09-30 10:08:24,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
516877207755431936,2014-09-30 09:08:24,"Somebody! Anybody!!! Goddess of Time, help us please! We need more time!"
516862126715990017,2014-09-30 08:08:28,H-h-hoooo...It's cold. This cold has me hallucinating about Darmani. I can't take it.
516847017994108928,2014-09-30 07:08:26,Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone and attracted some weirdo's attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.
516831887919026176,2014-09-30 06:08:19,"Ahh, I wanna find a girlfriend and get married soon, too..."
516816827645583360,2014-09-30 05:08:28,Aw! No way! You finally got me!
516801711088730113,2014-09-30 04:08:24,But Deku Scrubs are supposed to like rain. At least one of us has reason to be happy...
516786614823948289,2014-09-30 03:08:25,"You have strange powers, no? Me been watching you!"
516771522984165376,2014-09-30 02:08:26,Anju is already fleeing to Cremia's ranch.
516756389499121665,2014-09-30 01:08:18,Return the flow of time to normal?
516741344178343936,2014-09-30 00:08:31,You traded the Moon's Tear for a Land Title Deed!
516726257501741056,2014-09-29 23:08:34,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
516711080513384449,2014-09-29 22:08:16,Buying two of the same thing won't do you any good.
516695944570486784,2014-09-29 21:08:07,"That's a Gekko. And it's pretty angry! It's pretty weak, too. It really shouldn't be making a fool of you."
516680864818679808,2014-09-29 20:08:12,We shouldn't change the song now... Guru-Guru is scary when he gets mad...
516665763013214208,2014-09-29 19:08:11,The horse seems to like this song.
516650664198299648,2014-09-29 18:08:11,"You got Don Gero's Mask! It looks just like Don Gero, conductor of the frog choir!"
516635541639421952,2014-09-29 17:08:06,You got the Boss Key! Now you can enter the chamber where the boss lurks!
516620459761094657,2014-09-29 16:08:10,"Umm, Mommy... Don't go picking up bomb bags in the middle of the night anymore."
516605349600571392,2014-09-29 15:08:08,What do you want? Don't look down at me! Adults shouldn't mess with kids' games!
516590331572150272,2014-09-29 14:08:27,The canyon at Stone Tower lies this way. Be careful.
516560100752764930,2014-09-29 12:08:19,"They fall from what looks to be the moon's eye, so I call them Moon's Tears."
516545016341090304,2014-09-29 11:08:23,"I am Dampe, the grave keeper, who watches over this graveyard. My face is frightening, but I am not a bad person!"
516529895699001344,2014-09-29 10:08:18,"If it's possible, put the scent in something and take it to the Magic Hags' Potion Shop."
516514816458903553,2014-09-29 09:08:23,"And just between you and me, the Skull Kid is no match for the Great Fairy."
516499722261901312,2014-09-29 08:08:24,I tell you...Tingle is the very reincarnation of a fairy!
516484623732178945,2014-09-29 07:08:24,"Returning to Snowhead, are you? It's dangerous at night, so be especially careful."
516469503274663937,2014-09-29 06:08:19,But Deku Scrubs are supposed to like rain. At least one of us has reason to be happy...
516454413599129600,2014-09-29 05:08:22,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
516439318328406016,2014-09-29 04:08:23,The drink even boosts your magic stamina! Swirl it around with your tongue to enjoy its flavor to the fullest!
516424215428231169,2014-09-29 03:08:22,Your notes echoed far... but nothing happened.
516409167813165056,2014-09-29 02:08:34,"When you wear it, you will transform into the shape you just were. When you remove it, you will return to normal."
516394004728905728,2014-09-29 01:08:19,Are you suggesting that my instructions will put you to sleep? How rude! Be gone!
516378924276670464,2014-09-29 00:08:24,That's Romani's Mask. Only adult customers can get that mask.
516363840997429248,2014-09-28 23:08:27,"But something has to be done about this cold. Otherwise, we'll be Goronsicles."
516348680731758592,2014-09-28 22:08:13,"Stop right there, Deku Scrub!"
516333556029603840,2014-09-28 21:08:07,"Pa-Pa-Pa-Paper, please!"
516318473304023040,2014-09-28 20:08:11,Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone and attracted some weirdo's attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.
516303346123018241,2014-09-28 19:08:04,Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon. Hurry... The four who are there... Bring them here...
516288277586792448,2014-09-28 18:08:12,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
516273150741344256,2014-09-28 17:08:05,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
516258073510293504,2014-09-28 16:08:10,Oh no! The Great Fairy!
516242964662599680,2014-09-28 15:08:08,"This melody, lingering on the edges of your mind, is a song of memories of Princess Zelda."
516227945094856705,2014-09-28 14:08:27,You got the Fierce Deity's Mask! Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?
516212808975777792,2014-09-28 13:08:19,It takes courage to come thieving in the Pirates' Fortress!
516197714812346368,2014-09-28 12:08:20,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
516182653968449536,2014-09-28 11:08:29,Please take refuge. We are fine here. We shall greet the morning... together.
516167510022836225,2014-09-28 10:08:18,Night of the Final Day. 12 Hours Remain
516152404266323968,2014-09-28 09:08:17,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"
516137412741722112,2014-09-28 08:08:43,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"
516107154474795008,2014-09-28 06:08:29,"If you don't have a bow, you can't play."
516092066061766656,2014-09-28 05:08:31,Oh! Darmani! I've been waiting impatiently for you.
516076950700322816,2014-09-28 04:08:27,You got the Goron Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a proud Goron hero!
516061882315071488,2014-09-28 03:08:35,"Zero Rupees? Oh, that's a cruel joke!"
516046869202345984,2014-09-28 02:08:55,"What?! Don't you know about the Skullwalltula? ... Just don't touch it, all right?"
516031621674180608,2014-09-28 01:08:20,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
516016553561571328,2014-09-28 00:08:28,Huh? The moon? It's gotten bigger again. Th-this is bad...
516001514943283200,2014-09-27 23:08:42,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
515986305574920192,2014-09-27 22:08:16,"Is that so? Think it over, little guy!"
515971176972029952,2014-09-27 21:08:09,"This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy Racetrack, just like the sign says."
515956093151744000,2014-09-27 20:08:13,"Hey, you're kinda cool."
515940978176184320,2014-09-27 19:08:09,You got a Bomb Bag! Now you can carry and use bombs!
515925898038489088,2014-09-27 18:08:14,Ooh! Ooh! Guess what! Lulu's voice... She's gotten it back!
515910761344794624,2014-09-27 17:08:05,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
515895678430482432,2014-09-27 16:08:09,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
515880573542207488,2014-09-27 15:08:07,Don't you have a mask that can summon the unseen?
515865541890699264,2014-09-27 14:08:24,Huh? When did you get that instrument?!?
515850415980572673,2014-09-27 13:08:17,You got the Fierce Deity's Mask! Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?
515835321469005824,2014-09-27 12:08:19,That's Romani's Mask. Only adult customers can get that mask.
515820238021996544,2014-09-27 11:08:22,"You have strange powers, no? Me been watching you!"
515805114007707648,2014-09-27 10:08:17,"We have all been expecting your next order, sir."
515790030334218240,2014-09-27 09:08:20,"Look, I'd like you to buy my bomb, too, but it's just too heavy for you to carry. Sorry."
515774951383498755,2014-09-27 08:08:25,You cannot proceed any further through time...
515759834524700672,2014-09-27 07:08:21,"But something has to be done about this cold. Otherwise, we'll be Goronsicles."
515744737253285889,2014-09-27 06:08:22,"Hey, you're kinda cool."
515729636852908032,2014-09-27 05:08:21,"I bet if you had a weapon that was strong enough, one shot from it could pierce right through this!"
515714528646934529,2014-09-27 04:08:19,"Stop right there, Deku Scrub!"
515699436081532928,2014-09-27 03:08:21,The mask that was stolen from me... It is called Majora's Mask.
515684388881698816,2014-09-27 02:08:33,"No, no, daddy-o! That song doesn't sing to my heart, baby!"
515669211759140864,2014-09-27 01:08:15,You got the Zora Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a legendary guitarist!
515654155315052544,2014-09-27 00:08:25,"Ah! That stone! You must hand it over to me! In exchange, I'll give you my spot here... Deku Flower included!"
515623895747940352,2014-09-26 22:08:11,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
515608789559422976,2014-09-26 21:08:09,"Heyyy! You don't have that much! You shouldn't lie to people! And you can take that to the bank, mister!"
515593699435102210,2014-09-26 20:08:11,See! Look at the moon... Leave town before the evacuation notice is made!
515578587479408640,2014-09-26 19:08:08,"Oh, yeah! How was it? It went by in an instant, right? I'm still full of energy!"
515563515004735489,2014-09-26 18:08:15,"With black roses etched into it, the Great Fairy's Sword is the most powerful of all blades."
515548373781204992,2014-09-26 17:08:05,"(Translation) I am disappointed, oh moon. I have died!"
515533307971268609,2014-09-26 16:08:13,You put a Zora Egg in a bottle! It doesn't look very healthy. You'd better have someone examine it quick!
515518179011883009,2014-09-26 15:08:06,"Oh, yeah...and, um... The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!"
515503163231576064,2014-09-26 14:08:26,Ooh! Ooh! Guess what! Lulu's voice... She's gotten it back!
515488032233771011,2014-09-26 13:08:18,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
515472937566994432,2014-09-26 12:08:20,"If you came here to go swimming, you should go somewhere else."
515457875737473024,2014-09-26 11:08:28,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
515442737835802626,2014-09-26 10:08:19,I'll be on vacation for a short while. Please don't look for me.
515428007482122240,2014-09-26 09:09:47,"I wanna be one when I grow up, too."
515412557071261696,2014-09-26 08:08:24,"No, no, daddy-o! That song doesn't sing to my heart, baby!"
515397438899630080,2014-09-26 07:08:19,But outside it seems to have gotten kind of...dangerous. Yikes... I'm gettin' outta town!
515382336389513216,2014-09-26 06:08:18,"It's a White Boe... Just calm down and attack it! Yeah, yeah, yeah... There are just a lot of them, OK?"
515367259586326528,2014-09-26 05:08:24,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
515352139472703488,2014-09-26 04:08:19,The canyon at Stone Tower lies this way. Be careful.
515337049952354304,2014-09-26 03:08:21,"(Translation) I am disappointed, oh moon. I have died!"
515321962629853186,2014-09-26 02:08:24,"Though you may not understand these grown-up matters, you should probably take the pendant to Anju, anyway."
515291765926944768,2014-09-26 00:08:25,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"
515276700137947136,2014-09-25 23:08:33,"Oh, the Circus Leader's Mask! He comes here a lot."
515261513318154240,2014-09-25 22:08:12,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
515246387798089728,2014-09-25 21:08:06,"It's a Wart. Once you've gotten rid of the spheres that shield the main body, you can attack the eye."
515231312165093376,2014-09-25 20:08:12,Return the flow of time to normal?
515216188666687489,2014-09-25 19:08:06,"You got the Bremen Mask! This mask belonged to the leader  of the animal troupe. Try parading it around tiny, young animals."
515201117265743872,2014-09-25 18:08:12,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
515185992328675328,2014-09-25 17:08:06,It's a mystical song that allows you to shed a shell shaped in your current image.
515170909951246336,2014-09-25 16:08:11,Ooh! Ooh! Guess what! Lulu's voice... She's gotten it back!
515155805167816705,2014-09-25 15:08:09,"This isn't ""members-only,"" so take that thing off. I kid you not!"
515140769917587456,2014-09-25 14:08:25,"Upon impact, it makes a blinding flash, freezing enemies in their tracks!"
515125638546456578,2014-09-25 13:08:17,You learned the Lullaby Intro! The soothing melody of a thoughtful father.
515110548640256000,2014-09-25 12:08:19,You got the Zora Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a legendary guitarist!
515095472071909376,2014-09-25 11:08:25,You did it! You helped Cremia! You feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Sigh... You could get used to this!
515080377392574465,2014-09-25 10:08:26,"Ye who hold the sacred sword, leave proof of our encounter."
515065257291567106,2014-09-25 09:08:21,"I bet if you had a weapon that was strong enough, one shot from it could pierce right through this!"
515035069337964544,2014-09-25 07:08:24,"And just between you and me, the Skull Kid is no match for the Great Fairy."
515020003326701568,2014-09-25 06:08:32,Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone and attracted some weirdo's attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.
515004884878258176,2014-09-25 05:08:27,Well...could you see it? It already may be impossible to stop its descent...
514989788978348032,2014-09-25 04:08:28,"That won't do you any good. Hee, hee."
514974688166957056,2014-09-25 03:08:28,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
514959611988680704,2014-09-25 02:08:33,Please take refuge. We are fine here. We shall greet the morning... together.
514944459360858113,2014-09-25 01:08:20,Please enjoy the Carnival of Time.
514929396809875458,2014-09-25 00:08:29,"Yeah, he's back, big brother."
514914331616493568,2014-09-24 23:08:37,Leeeaave me something small and creepy!
514899138794627072,2014-09-24 22:08:15,Huh? When did you get that instrument?!?
514884012540567554,2014-09-24 21:08:09,But outside it seems to have gotten kind of...dangerous. Yikes... I'm gettin' outta town!
514853817557336064,2014-09-24 19:08:10,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
514838725805621248,2014-09-24 18:08:12,Bremor! Don't be standin' 'round lookin' at yer feet all day!
514823612105101312,2014-09-24 17:08:08,All right! That Skull Kid broke our rules and he's been doing all kinds of bad things lately.
514808531858374656,2014-09-24 16:08:13,"If you came here to go swimming, you should go somewhere else."
514793478643916802,2014-09-24 15:08:24,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
514778460237987841,2014-09-24 14:08:43,"If it's possible, put the scent in something and take it to the Magic Hags' Potion Shop."
514763266711511041,2014-09-24 13:08:21,Those sideburns...Aren't you Darmani? You're supposed to be dead...but you're alive? What have you been doing?
514733083690418176,2014-09-24 11:08:25,"You can't use any of them, but feel free to look around."
514717976608522240,2014-09-24 10:08:23,"If you leave my mask out there, something terrible will happen!"
514702882080169985,2014-09-24 09:08:24,It's true! Surely the great Darmani can do something about the blizzard that blows in from Snowhead.
514672676963504129,2014-09-24 07:08:23,Open your ears and listen hard!
514657563816648704,2014-09-24 06:08:19,Be careful... I sense a lot of evil here.

514627383693811714,2014-09-24 04:08:24,Young one! Please hear my plea! I have been broken and shattered to pieces by the masked Skull Kid.
514612276951658496,2014-09-24 03:08:22,"Hey, guy! You haven't passed my test, so how do you know my secret code?"

514536732822216704,2014-09-23 22:08:11,"Hey, you're kinda cool."
514521624540766208,2014-09-23 21:08:09,Well...could you see it? It already may be impossible to stop its descent...

514476366209617920,2014-09-23 18:08:18,You bought back the Gilded Sword that was stolen from you!
514461230543548416,2014-09-23 17:08:10,The drink even boosts your magic stamina! Swirl it around with your tongue to enjoy its flavor to the fullest!
514446134790475779,2014-09-23 16:08:11,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"

514400895824433152,2014-09-23 13:08:25,Grrrr... We're the notorious Gorman Brothers! We can't get all sappy over stuff like this!
514385782476255232,2014-09-23 12:08:22,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
514370722035011584,2014-09-23 11:08:31,"Somehow, I feel as if I am once again racing with my son..."

512075565533118464,2014-09-17 03:08:23,You played the Oath to Order!
512060478420299776,2014-09-17 02:08:26,"That won't do you any good. Hee, hee."
512045342301237248,2014-09-17 01:08:17,"OK, it's closing time. Quick! Get outta here!"
512030307327811584,2014-09-17 00:08:32,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
512015200464023552,2014-09-16 23:08:31,"You got the Bunny Hood! My, what long ears it has! Will the power of the wild spring forth?"
512000016215334912,2014-09-16 22:08:11,"My son often used that mask to find mushrooms in the forest. Oh, how I long for those days."
511984912518234112,2014-09-16 21:08:10,"What?! Don't you know about the Skullwalltula? ... Just don't touch it, all right?"
511969819017494528,2014-09-16 20:08:11,What do you want? Don't look down at me! Adults shouldn't mess with kids' games!
511954699994406912,2014-09-16 19:08:06,It takes courage to come thieving in the Pirates' Fortress!
511939672587919360,2014-09-16 18:08:23,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
511924495456538627,2014-09-16 17:08:05,"It's strange, but the way you look right now sort of looks like this tree..."
511909427419443200,2014-09-16 16:08:12,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
511894302847270912,2014-09-16 15:08:06,"Oh, the Circus Leader's Mask! He comes here a lot."
511879277466247169,2014-09-16 14:08:24,What are you doing?!? Didn't your shield just get swallowed???
511864151551901696,2014-09-16 13:08:18,Thanks for helping last night. The cows are doing well thanks to you. And they're putting out a lot of milk!
511849059422711808,2014-09-16 12:08:20,"Hee, hee! Now, that's a good look for you! You'll stay here looking that way forever!"
511833978752348160,2014-09-16 11:08:24,Leeeaave me something small and creepy!
511818861004345344,2014-09-16 10:08:20,"What?! Don't you know about the Skullwalltula? ... Just don't touch it, all right?"
511803768103387136,2014-09-16 09:08:21,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.
511788670760677376,2014-09-16 08:08:22,"I hear some ghosts or something appeared at Romani Ranch yesterday, and now all their cows are gone."
511773557752209408,2014-09-16 07:08:19,Please take refuge. We are fine here. We shall greet the morning... together.
511758463500701696,2014-09-16 06:08:20,"Yeah, he's back, big brother."
511743373321850880,2014-09-16 05:08:22,Oh... You've collected some nice masks!
511728266567106560,2014-09-16 04:08:20,"Oh, kind young one! Please find the fairies trapped in Great Bay Temple."
511713166523236352,2014-09-16 03:08:20,Whaaat?!? You're really gonna give me that much? You're one rich little guy!
511698118035791872,2014-09-16 02:08:32,Don't you have a mask that can summon the unseen?
511682964451651584,2014-09-16 01:08:19,"(Translation) I am disappointed, oh moon. I have died!"
511667898503270400,2014-09-16 00:08:27,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
511652804557959168,2014-09-15 23:08:29,"Why was the...? Why was the...? Why was the dog the leader?!? Was it 'cause something was wrong with me, sir???"
511637632485310464,2014-09-15 22:08:12,"This isn't ""members-only,"" so take that thing off. I kid you not!"
511622517954322432,2014-09-15 21:08:08,And they say the world is a hard place. Look at you! I'd say you're pretty lucky!
511607440073166848,2014-09-15 20:08:13,"Are you, by chance, a boat cruise customer?"
511592318982291457,2014-09-15 19:08:08,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
511577232871936001,2014-09-15 18:08:11,"It's a Gibdo. You won't be able to move if it glares at you, so be careful!"
511562111378395137,2014-09-15 17:08:06,"Oh, it was the fairy's light. In that case, it's just perfect."
511547032905859072,2014-09-15 16:08:11,"From now on, be more aware of birds when you're strolling down the road..."
511531922174918656,2014-09-15 15:08:08,You played the Inverted Song of Time!
511516934664224768,2014-09-15 14:08:35,Bremor! Don't be standin' 'round lookin' at yer feet all day!
511501783340814336,2014-09-15 13:08:23,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
511471613951217664,2014-09-15 11:08:30,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
511456509255901185,2014-09-15 10:08:28,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
511441407022596097,2014-09-15 09:08:28,"We offer our customers limited-run milk. Thus, we are a members-only establishment."
511426310678122498,2014-09-15 08:08:28,"Ahh, I wanna find a girlfriend and get married soon, too..."
511411232125906945,2014-09-15 07:08:33,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
511396087211376640,2014-09-15 06:08:23,"You got Don Gero's Mask! It looks just like Don Gero, conductor of the frog choir!"
511380997510668288,2014-09-15 05:08:25,"If you're going to Great Bay, your timing is great. You should leave here as quickly as you can!"
511365890395238400,2014-09-15 04:08:23,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
511350821452144640,2014-09-15 03:08:30,I'll be on vacation for a short while. Please don't look for me.
511335778811523072,2014-09-15 02:08:44,"No, no, daddy-o! That song doesn't sing to my heart, baby!"
511320579857588225,2014-09-15 01:08:20,I tell you...Tingle is the very reincarnation of a fairy!
511305539054088194,2014-09-15 00:08:34,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
511290424330178561,2014-09-14 23:08:31,"It is dangerous outside the town walls, so I cannot allow a child like you to... A sword?"
511275251133464578,2014-09-14 22:08:13,You traded the Moon's Tear for a Land Title Deed!
511245053117743104,2014-09-14 20:08:13,See! Look at the moon... Leave town before the evacuation notice is made!
511229940075737089,2014-09-14 19:08:10,"That melody's bogus, man!"
511214846830837760,2014-09-14 18:08:12,You got a Magic Jar! Your magic power is replenished!
511199720648089600,2014-09-14 17:08:05,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
511184644062998528,2014-09-14 16:08:11,You did it! You helped Cremia! You feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Sigh... You could get used to this!
511169528592494592,2014-09-14 15:08:07,I don't need that weird mask!
511154525797765120,2014-09-14 14:08:30,"Somebody! Anybody!!! Goddess of Time, help us please! We need more time!"
511139466254098432,2014-09-14 13:08:39,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
511124303731888129,2014-09-14 12:08:24,"Man, I just work here part-time, so I don't really know this stuff."
511109226253389824,2014-09-14 11:08:30,W-What just happened?! Everything has... started over...
511094111009394688,2014-09-14 10:08:26,You cannot proceed any further through time...
511078992166666241,2014-09-14 09:08:21,"Suddenly, memories of Princess Zelda come rushing back to you..."
511063921982054400,2014-09-14 08:08:28,You traded the Moon's Tear for a Land Title Deed!
511048808692600832,2014-09-14 07:08:25,"What's this? Green clothes... White fairy... Sir, could you, by chance, be a forest fairy?"
511033711572164610,2014-09-14 06:08:26,You got the Goron Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a proud Goron hero!
511018620361527296,2014-09-14 05:08:28,"Waaah...Henh, uwaaaaah... Daaaaaddy, daaaddy...H-hunh... I'm cooold, Daaaddy!"
511003588366057472,2014-09-14 04:08:44,"If you came here to go swimming, you should go somewhere else."
510988418902282240,2014-09-14 03:08:27,You bought back the Gilded Sword that was stolen from you!
510973324357160960,2014-09-14 02:08:28,You got a Bomb Bag! Now you can carry and use bombs!
510958188057726977,2014-09-14 01:08:19,"Stop right there, Deku Scrub!"
510943132490289152,2014-09-14 00:08:30,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
510928036426825728,2014-09-13 23:08:31,You got a Silver Rupee! It's worth 100 Rupees! You're pretty happy!
510912861602738178,2014-09-13 22:08:13,"My son often used that mask to find mushrooms in the forest. Oh, how I long for those days."
510897759390420992,2014-09-13 21:08:12,You have just freed the innocent spirit that this dark mask had kept imprisoned within the body of evil Odolwa.
510882669517733888,2014-09-13 20:08:14,"It's strange, but the way you look right now sort of looks like this tree..."
510867543892819968,2014-09-13 19:08:08,"This does the trick when you need energy, but you need an empty bottle to keep it in..."
510852473691451392,2014-09-13 18:08:15,"Accepting this keepsake doesn't make much sense to you, but you should take it anyway."
510837336695791616,2014-09-13 17:08:06,You got the Keaton Mask! This is Kafei's mask of memories.
510822261461233664,2014-09-13 16:08:12,You cannot proceed any further through time...
510807141439905793,2014-09-13 15:08:07,The drink even boosts your magic stamina! Swirl it around with your tongue to enjoy its flavor to the fullest!
510792122056712192,2014-09-13 14:08:26,You traded the Moon's Tear for a Land Title Deed!
510776981202276353,2014-09-13 13:08:16,It's true! Surely the great Darmani can do something about the blizzard that blows in from Snowhead.
510761888183898112,2014-09-13 12:08:18,Ye who hold my remains... Return to the appointed place to face me...
510746831140036609,2014-09-13 11:08:28,What are you doing?!? Didn't your shield just get swallowed???
510731709059321856,2014-09-13 10:08:23,"Though you may not understand these grown-up matters, you should probably take the pendant to Anju, anyway."
510716619484442624,2014-09-13 09:08:25,No way! No Scrubs!
510701535014035458,2014-09-13 08:08:28,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
510686402376663041,2014-09-13 07:08:21,You did it! You helped Cremia! You feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Sigh... You could get used to this!
510671303821373440,2014-09-13 06:08:21,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
510656212732366848,2014-09-13 05:08:23,You learned the Lullaby Intro! The soothing melody of a thoughtful father.
510641112030007296,2014-09-13 04:08:23,"It's a Desbreko. Once it bites you, it's not gonna want to let go. I haaaate this thing!"
510626017140961280,2014-09-13 03:08:24,"That won't do you any good. Hee, hee."
510610924411965440,2014-09-13 02:08:25,You got a Magic Jar! Your magic power is replenished!
510595799508475905,2014-09-13 01:08:19,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
510565624381067264,2014-09-12 23:08:25,"Huh? Do you mean you haven't been approved to carry Powder Kegs, yet?"
510550480406478848,2014-09-12 22:08:14,Leeeaave me something small and creepy!
510535357260001280,2014-09-12 21:08:09,Huh? When did you get that instrument?!?
510520264430333953,2014-09-12 20:08:10,The ghosts of a hundred soldiers swear allegiance to this symbol of authority.
510505174607990784,2014-09-12 19:08:13,"Yeah, he's back, big brother."
510490081321172992,2014-09-12 18:08:14,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
510459870005313536,2014-09-12 16:08:11,Oh my? The Couple's Mask? Someone got married.
510444756933963776,2014-09-12 15:08:08,Ruff! ...I'm here for my wife and child. There's no way I'll lose!
510429725815078912,2014-09-12 14:08:24,I'm sorry. We're totally booked with reservations. Please tell that to your mother.
510414596524347392,2014-09-12 13:08:17,I made a reservation... The name is Link-goro!
510399507662512128,2014-09-12 12:08:20,The mask that was stolen from me... It is called Majora's Mask.
510384427348668416,2014-09-12 11:08:24,H-h-hoooo...It's cold. This cold has me hallucinating about Darmani. I can't take it.
510369304806576128,2014-09-12 10:08:19,Strange... Isn't it? Getting a letter from a missing person...
510354210068520961,2014-09-12 09:08:20,That ill-mannered troublemaker from the other day said he'd break my instruments...
510339124520181760,2014-09-12 08:08:23,No way! No Scrubs!
510324012103106560,2014-09-12 07:08:20,Well...could you see it? It already may be impossible to stop its descent...
510308906489221120,2014-09-12 06:08:19,Ooh! Ooh! Guess what! Lulu's voice... She's gotten it back!
510293812128661505,2014-09-12 05:08:20,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
510278715331190784,2014-09-12 04:08:20,Return the flow of time to normal?
510263619511005184,2014-09-12 03:08:21,Sorry! Pretend you didn't hear that. My sister will get mad at me.
510248547468341248,2014-09-12 02:08:28,No using masks in the store because of past indiscretions!
510233391585714176,2014-09-12 01:08:14,What do you want? Don't look down at me! Adults shouldn't mess with kids' games!
510218357367263232,2014-09-12 00:08:30,"That won't do you any good. Hee, hee."
510203241624133633,2014-09-11 23:08:26,"Oh, the Circus Leader's Mask! He comes here a lot."
510188079433277441,2014-09-11 22:08:11,"Heyyy! You don't have that much! You shouldn't lie to people! And you can take that to the bank, mister!"
510172969226612736,2014-09-11 21:08:09,"Stop right there, Deku Scrub!"
510157881446920193,2014-09-11 20:08:11,Are you suggesting that my instructions will put you to sleep? How rude! Be gone!
510142764936220672,2014-09-11 19:08:07,"Certainly, he had far too many weaknesses to use my power."
510127685100511232,2014-09-11 18:08:12,"Do you already have bombs, the special product of the Gorons?"
510112558578036736,2014-09-11 17:08:06,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"
510097477660205056,2014-09-11 16:08:10,What's that?!? The Skull Kid got to Koume?!?
510082368707633153,2014-09-11 15:08:08,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.
510052222244118532,2014-09-11 13:08:20,"This melody, lingering on the edges of your mind, is a song of memories of Princess Zelda."

507032326719565824,2014-09-03 05:08:21,It's a Hiploop. Quickly dodge it if it charges at you. But can't you first do something about that mask it's wearing?

506654833370083328,2014-09-02 04:08:20,"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?"
506639725029912576,2014-09-02 03:08:18,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.

506549080378449920,2014-09-01 21:08:06,I can tell you're not very used to your Deku Scrub body yet.
506534001016729601,2014-09-01 20:08:11,You played the Inverted Song of Time!
506518875177889793,2014-09-01 19:08:05,I don't need that weird mask!

506307576846229504,2014-09-01 05:08:27,"You're not thinking I'm stealing your song, do you?"
506292537997291520,2014-09-01 04:08:42,"If you play that strange song backwards, you can slow the flow of time."

506050876675354624,2014-08-31 12:08:25,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
506035795975606272,2014-08-31 11:08:30,We were about to punish an innocent monkey!
506020673559330816,2014-08-31 10:08:24,It takes courage to come thieving in the Pirates' Fortress!
506005587386044417,2014-08-31 09:08:27,You caught a Big Poe in a bottle! This may lead to something good...
505990489720381440,2014-08-31 08:08:28,"Hey, Skull Kid! Do you realize what you've been doing to everyone?!?"
505975379996073984,2014-08-31 07:08:25,"100 steps north, 100 steps south, 100 steps east, 100 steps west. The spot at which those giants parted is right in the middle of this town."
505960449829916673,2014-08-31 06:09:06,It's a Hiploop. Quickly dodge it if it charges at you. But can't you first do something about that mask it's wearing?
505945261114273792,2014-08-31 05:08:44,That's Romani's Mask. Only adult customers can get that mask.
505930197074313216,2014-08-31 04:08:53,I don't need that weird mask!
505914976070946816,2014-08-31 03:08:24,"If you could somehow step on top of that Octorok, I bet you'd be able to climb onto that central pillar."
505899971673993216,2014-08-31 02:08:47,Will you stop staring and just open that door for me?!?
505884756639100928,2014-08-31 01:08:19,You found all the Stray Fairies! Quick! Take them to their fellow fairies of the same color!
505869710261383170,2014-08-31 00:08:32,We were about to punish an innocent monkey!
505854607549939712,2014-08-30 23:08:31,"Even if it's just out of pure stubbornness, I'm going to keep the shop going..."
505839440602726400,2014-08-30 22:08:15,Uuuuurgh...I'm scared! I can't take it! I don't want to die!
505824321613230080,2014-08-30 21:08:10,"Yeah, he's back, big brother."
505809245011316736,2014-08-30 20:08:16,Buying two of the same thing won't do you any good.
505794140571840512,2014-08-30 19:08:14,Are you suggesting that my instructions will put you to sleep? How rude! Be gone!
505779051986829312,2014-08-30 18:08:17,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
505763921244872704,2014-08-30 17:08:10,"I'm sure it was because he was always playing tricks, so nobody wanted to play with him."
505748837504253952,2014-08-30 16:08:13,I'll just teach you the beginning...
505733730955055104,2014-08-30 15:08:12,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
505718736460849152,2014-08-30 14:08:37,What's this? You've already saved up 5000 Rupees?!
505703601428111360,2014-08-30 13:08:28,"I must hurry! The guest arriving in the afternoon will come. Skip this, skip that!"
505688504278343680,2014-08-30 12:08:29,"Is that so? Think it over, little guy!"
505673425180848128,2014-08-30 11:08:34,Oh! Darmani! I've been waiting impatiently for you.
505658287627313152,2014-08-30 10:08:25,"Oh my, what are you doing to my dogs? Put the dog down and step away from the kennel!"
505643223067271168,2014-08-30 09:08:33,Please take refuge. We are fine here. We shall greet the morning... together.
505628102496489473,2014-08-30 08:08:28,I entered to win some concert tickets... Don't ya have anything to deliver to me?
505612988737265664,2014-08-30 07:08:25,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
505597892292116480,2014-08-30 06:08:25,I don't need that weird mask!
505582804185268224,2014-08-30 05:08:28,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
505567843996295168,2014-08-30 04:09:01,Thank you for returning my broken and shattered body to normal.
505552698989486080,2014-08-30 03:08:50,Are you suggesting that my instructions will put you to sleep? How rude! Be gone!
505537581681889280,2014-08-30 02:08:46,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
505522376084164609,2014-08-30 01:08:21,"They fall from what looks to be the moon's eye, so I call them Moon's Tears."
505507326011252736,2014-08-30 00:08:33,"Are you, by chance, a boat cruise customer?"
505492233588449280,2014-08-29 23:08:34,"What?! Don't you know about the Skullwalltula? ... Just don't touch it, all right?"
505477053336928256,2014-08-29 22:08:15,"When you wear it, you will transform into the shape you just were. When you remove it, you will return to normal."
505461940584316928,2014-08-29 21:08:12,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
505446852733321216,2014-08-29 20:08:15,It's a mystical song that allows you to shed a shell shaped in your current image.
505431732145762304,2014-08-29 19:08:10,Have you been to the Clock Tower plaza yet?
505416693066133504,2014-08-29 18:08:24,"It is dangerous outside the town walls, so I cannot allow a child like you to... A sword?"
505401533819670528,2014-08-29 17:08:10,This is the Bombers' Notebook. It contains the words we live by! Read it over!
505386458027274240,2014-08-29 16:08:15,"Waaah...Henh, uwaaaaah... Daaaaaddy, daaaddy...H-hunh... I'm cooold, Daaaddy!"
505371340015038465,2014-08-29 15:08:11,Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon. Hurry... The four who are there... Bring them here...
505356331373457410,2014-08-29 14:08:33,"It's a Gibdo. You won't be able to move if it glares at you, so be careful!"
505341193958334464,2014-08-29 13:08:24,No using masks in the store because of past indiscretions!
505326107449503744,2014-08-29 12:08:27,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
505311028918239232,2014-08-29 11:08:32,Your notes echoed far... but nothing happened.
505295885052284928,2014-08-29 10:08:21,The moon has gotten so large! Quick! Take refuge as far away from town as you can!
505280798375673858,2014-08-29 09:08:24,It looks like the lady is taking a break. Let's not bother her.
505265737863139328,2014-08-29 08:08:33,Ye who hold my remains... Return to the appointed place to face me...
505250591530971136,2014-08-29 07:08:22,"Oh, yeah...and, um... The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!"
505235532629028864,2014-08-29 06:08:32,"Pa-Pa-Pa-Paper, please!"
505220435005304832,2014-08-29 05:08:32,Strange... Isn't it? Getting a letter from a missing person...
505205301893541888,2014-08-29 04:08:24,I have a request! Kafei... I have a clue... that will help you find him.
505190206094327809,2014-08-29 03:08:25,"Ohh, how adorable! Let me tug on your long ears. If you study the way of the sword here, you'll get your bunny dirty, so put it away."
505175122831884289,2014-08-29 02:08:29,Please take refuge. We are fine here. We shall greet the morning... together.
505159978487775232,2014-08-29 01:08:18,Hullo. Did ya come to buy a Powder Keg?
505144949415755776,2014-08-29 00:08:35,"Ahh, I wanna find a girlfriend and get married soon, too..."
505129835203543041,2014-08-28 23:08:32,Thanks for helping last night. The cows are doing well thanks to you. And they're putting out a lot of milk!
505114669783072769,2014-08-28 22:08:16,"My son often used that mask to find mushrooms in the forest. Oh, how I long for those days."
505099546980937728,2014-08-28 21:08:10,"Hey, Skull Kid! Do you realize what you've been doing to everyone?!?"
505084476418822144,2014-08-28 20:08:17,You caught a Big Poe in a bottle! This may lead to something good...
505069342203998208,2014-08-28 19:08:09,I can tell you're not very used to your Deku Scrub body yet.
505054284304490496,2014-08-28 18:08:19,That ill-mannered troublemaker from the other day said he'd break my instruments...
505039152463638528,2014-08-28 17:08:11,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
505024067343118336,2014-08-28 16:08:15,H-h-hoooo...It's cold. This cold has me hallucinating about Darmani. I can't take it.
505008951574810625,2014-08-28 15:08:11,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
504993937635827713,2014-08-28 14:08:31,Have you been to the Clock Tower plaza yet?
504978802171076608,2014-08-28 13:08:23,Only Sakon can open it. The only way in is to wait for Sakon to arrive.
504963756225343490,2014-08-28 12:08:35,I'll never forget the days we spent together in Hyrule...
504948620068524032,2014-08-28 11:08:27,"It's a White Boe... Just calm down and attack it! Yeah, yeah, yeah... There are just a lot of them, OK?"
504933498033938432,2014-08-28 10:08:21,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
504918401483943936,2014-08-28 09:08:22,"Hey, Skull Kid, what if you gave that mask you're wearing back now?"
504903337825693696,2014-08-28 08:08:31,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."
504888228000702465,2014-08-28 07:08:28,"I hear some ghosts or something appeared at Romani Ranch yesterday, and now all their cows are gone."
504873102057033731,2014-08-28 06:08:22,I made a reservation... The name is Link-goro!
504858135270416384,2014-08-28 05:08:53,"If you could somehow step on top of that Octorok, I bet you'd be able to climb onto that central pillar."
504842915655335936,2014-08-28 04:08:25,"That won't do you any good. Hee, hee."
504827847886659584,2014-08-28 03:08:32,You did it! You helped Cremia! You feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Sigh... You could get used to this!
504812770244558849,2014-08-28 02:08:38,"If you play that strange song backwards, you can slow the flow of time."
504797590127255552,2014-08-28 01:08:18,"I'm sure it was because he was always playing tricks, so nobody wanted to play with him."
504782501244465152,2014-08-28 00:08:21,"Hee, hee! Now, that's a good look for you! You'll stay here looking that way forever!"
504767428077703168,2014-08-27 23:08:27,I'm terribly sorry. There are no vacancies today...We're booked solid with reservations.
504752248849584128,2014-08-27 22:08:08,"Zero Rupees? Oh, that's a cruel joke!"
504737164702150656,2014-08-27 21:08:12,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you or whatever."
504722075118870528,2014-08-27 20:08:14,"Ah! That stone! You must hand it over to me! In exchange, I'll give you my spot here... Deku Flower included!"
504706955349618688,2014-08-27 19:08:09,Are you suggesting that my instructions will put you to sleep? How rude! Be gone!
504691883734347776,2014-08-27 18:08:16,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
504676735237894144,2014-08-27 17:08:04,You have just freed the innocent spirit that this dark mask had kept imprisoned within the body of evil Odolwa.
504661657956540416,2014-08-27 16:08:10,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
504646544667049984,2014-08-27 15:08:06,I...I shall consume. Consume...Consume everything.
504631521366388738,2014-08-27 14:08:24,I tell you...Tingle is the very reincarnation of a fairy!
504616385398312960,2014-08-27 13:08:16,"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?"
504601317780631552,2014-08-27 12:08:23,"It's a Wart. Once you've gotten rid of the spheres that shield the main body, you can attack the eye."
504586283688026112,2014-08-27 11:08:39,I can tell you're not very used to your Deku Scrub body yet.
504571113842569218,2014-08-27 10:08:22,You traded for the Largest Quiver! Now you can now hold up to 50 arrows!
504556007716966400,2014-08-27 09:08:21,Oh! Darmani! I've been waiting impatiently for you.
504540928460083200,2014-08-27 08:08:25,"If you're gonna fall, then what's stoppin' ya, you monster?!"
504525809554427905,2014-08-27 07:08:21,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
504510739986382849,2014-08-27 06:08:28,"That melody's bogus, man!"
504495617339428864,2014-08-27 05:08:22,"You're our bodyguard, Grasshopper, so all you have to do is practice hard!"
504480523561865216,2014-08-27 04:08:24,Return the flow of time to normal?
504465419432759297,2014-08-27 03:08:23,Strange... Isn't it? Getting a letter from a missing person...
504450430013685760,2014-08-27 02:08:49,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
504435204828590080,2014-08-27 01:08:19,You got the Boss Key! Now you can enter the chamber where the boss lurks!
504420126070800384,2014-08-27 00:08:24,"My son often used that mask to find mushrooms in the forest. Oh, how I long for those days."
504405095862128642,2014-08-26 23:08:40,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
504389876880400384,2014-08-26 22:08:12,No using masks in the store because of past indiscretions!
504359682094268416,2014-08-26 20:08:13,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
504344566409879553,2014-08-26 19:08:09,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.
504329471587921920,2014-08-26 18:08:10,"It's a Desbreko. Once it bites you, it's not gonna want to let go. I haaaate this thing!"
504314351751159808,2014-08-26 17:08:05,"If people hear the great pirates have lost the treasure they stole, we'll become the laughing stock!"
504299271072403458,2014-08-26 16:08:10,"That won't do you any good. Hee, hee."
504284167014608896,2014-08-26 15:08:09,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
504269120041259008,2014-08-26 14:08:21,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
504253991639715840,2014-08-26 13:08:14,Buying two of the same thing won't do you any good.
504238917843836929,2014-08-26 12:08:20,Uuuuurgh...I'm scared! I can't take it! I don't want to die!
504223839841050624,2014-08-26 11:08:26,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
504208716384587778,2014-08-26 10:08:20,"Oh, it was the fairy's light. In that case, it's just perfect."
504193601803280384,2014-08-26 09:08:16,Your notes echoed far... but nothing happened.
504178548295225344,2014-08-26 08:08:27,"This is the room of Evan, the leader of the Zora Band, The Indigo-Go's."
504163413455405057,2014-08-26 07:08:19,You have just freed the innocent spirit that this dark mask had kept imprisoned within the body of evil Odolwa.
504148320437018625,2014-08-26 06:08:20,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"
504133240953634816,2014-08-26 05:08:25,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you, or whatever."
504118110429794304,2014-08-26 04:08:18,Young one! Please hear my plea! I have been broken and shattered to pieces by the masked Skull Kid.
504103025204412416,2014-08-26 03:08:21,"Ah! That stone! You must hand it over to me! In exchange, I'll give you my spot here... Deku Flower included!"
504087958270394369,2014-08-26 02:08:29,Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone and attracted some weirdo's attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.
504072814681284610,2014-08-26 01:08:18,Oh my? The Couple's Mask? Someone got married.
504057758686015488,2014-08-26 00:08:29,Ho! Ho! I hear it's gonna fall harder than the way my clumsy brother is always dropping our juggling balls!
504042689776451584,2014-08-25 23:08:36,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
504027524146294784,2014-08-25 22:08:20,I hate it! I hate it! I wanna see it! I wanna see it! I wanna see the race!

503921827261861888,2014-08-25 15:08:20,"They fall from what looks to be the moon's eye, so I call them Moon's Tears."

503891665296179200,2014-08-25 13:08:29,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
503861465984430080,2014-08-25 11:08:29,"Returning to Snowhead, are you? It's dangerous at night, so be especially careful."

503816146353528833,2014-08-25 08:08:24,"Yeah, he's back, big brother."
503801040710283265,2014-08-25 07:08:22,It's true! Surely the great Darmani can do something about the blizzard that blows in from Snowhead.
503785932168785920,2014-08-25 06:08:20,You put a Zora Egg in a bottle! It doesn't look very healthy. You'd better have someone examine it quick!
503770838319902721,2014-08-25 05:08:22,"Are you, by chance, a boat cruise customer?"
503755744307462144,2014-08-25 04:08:23,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
503740646335586304,2014-08-25 03:08:23,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"

503665097542103040,2014-08-24 22:08:11,H-h-hoooo...It's cold. This cold has me hallucinating about Darmani. I can't take it.
503650007912701952,2014-08-24 21:08:13,"Oh, it was the fairy's light. In that case, it's just perfect."
503634890999341057,2014-08-24 20:08:09,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."

503574489523683328,2014-08-24 16:08:08,You got the Fierce Deity's Mask! Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?
503559378222325761,2014-08-24 15:08:06,Will you stop staring and just open that door for me?!?
503544345820008449,2014-08-24 14:08:22,"This melody, lingering on the edges of your mind, is a song of memories of Princess Zelda."
503529247445487616,2014-08-24 13:08:22,It's a mystical song that allows you to shed a shell shaped in your current image.

503121530713165824,2014-08-23 10:08:15,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
503106449740820480,2014-08-23 09:08:19,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."

502940312877027328,2014-08-22 22:08:09,"Oh, why do we have to play these stupid brats' little games? C'mon! Hurry up and find them already!"

502668556517920770,2014-08-22 04:08:17,It's true! Surely the great Darmani can do something about the blizzard that blows in from Snowhead.
502653508093353984,2014-08-22 03:08:29,You cannot proceed any further through time...
502638465151143939,2014-08-22 02:08:43,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?

502321284307357696,2014-08-21 05:08:21,It's a Hiploop. Quickly dodge it if it charges at you. But can't you first do something about that mask it's wearing?
502306164005040129,2014-08-21 04:08:16,I entered to win some concert tickets... Don't ya have anything to deliver to me?

502170268274413569,2014-08-20 19:08:16,Sorry! Pretend you didn't hear that. My sister will get mad at me.
502155145933647872,2014-08-20 18:08:11,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.

502094803845140481,2014-08-20 14:08:24,"Huh? Do you mean you haven't been approved to carry Powder Kegs, yet?"
502079661669511168,2014-08-20 13:08:14,"When you wear it, you will transform into the shape you just were. When you remove it, you will return to normal."
502064579086520320,2014-08-20 12:08:18,It takes courage to come thieving in the Pirates' Fortress!
502049488865742848,2014-08-20 11:08:20,What do you want? Don't look down at me! Adults shouldn't mess with kids' games!

499784556631715840,2014-08-14 05:08:18,"If you don't have a bow, you can't play."
499769450044747777,2014-08-14 04:08:16,Leeeaave me something small and creepy!
499754357248651266,2014-08-14 03:08:18,Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone and attracted some weirdo's attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.
499739288422977536,2014-08-14 02:08:25,"Is that so? Think it over, little guy!"
499724155307048960,2014-08-14 01:08:17,"Even if it's just out of pure stubbornness, I'm going to keep the shop going..."
499709079804071937,2014-08-14 00:08:23,"Oh, kind young one! Please find the fairies trapped in Great Bay Temple."
499693981656047616,2014-08-13 23:08:23,Have you been to the Clock Tower plaza yet?
499678852172361731,2014-08-13 22:08:16,"I am Dampe, the grave keeper, who watches over this graveyard. My face is frightening, but I am not a bad person!"
499663748282322944,2014-08-13 21:08:15,I'll be on vacation for a short while. Please don't look for me.
499648651203846145,2014-08-13 20:08:16,"Oh, sorry. That's too bad. In that case, let me hear a song written by you, baby!"
499633522986864640,2014-08-13 19:08:09,"Pa-Pa-Pa-Paper, please!"
499618429783912448,2014-08-13 18:08:10,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
499603306612678657,2014-08-13 17:08:05,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
499588227351597057,2014-08-13 16:08:09,"Huh? Do you mean you haven't been approved to carry Powder Kegs, yet?"
499573125462253568,2014-08-13 15:08:09,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
499558103407292418,2014-08-13 14:08:27,It looks like the lady is taking a break. Let's not bother her.
499542947482722304,2014-08-13 13:08:14,"It's strange, but the way you look right now sort of looks like this tree..."
499527879709843457,2014-08-13 12:08:21,"If you play that strange song backwards, you can slow the flow of time."
499512817100152834,2014-08-13 11:08:30,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
499497672173035520,2014-08-13 10:08:19,You found all the Stray Fairies! Quick! Take them to their fellow fairies of the same color!
499482575300087810,2014-08-13 09:08:20,Your notes echoed far... but nothing happened.
499467489009360896,2014-08-13 08:08:23,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
499452381176684546,2014-08-13 07:08:21,"Zero Rupees? Oh, that's a cruel joke!"
499422192484876288,2014-08-13 05:08:24,"That won't do you any good. Hee, hee."
499407072551653376,2014-08-13 04:08:19,"Huh? Do you mean you haven't been approved to carry Powder Kegs, yet?"
499391975494139904,2014-08-13 03:08:19,All right! The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!
499376940218740736,2014-08-13 02:08:35,The moon has gotten so large! Quick! Take refuge as far away from town as you can!
499361764438315008,2014-08-13 01:08:16,I'm terribly sorry. There are no vacancies today...We're booked solid with reservations.
499346700180267008,2014-08-13 00:08:25,I hate it! I hate it! I wanna see it! I wanna see it! I wanna see the race!
499331627013529600,2014-08-12 23:08:31,"Hey, Skull Kid! Do you realize what you've been doing to everyone?!?"
499316436448182273,2014-08-12 22:08:09,You caught a Big Poe in a bottle! This may lead to something good...
499301337872338945,2014-08-12 21:08:10,"Pa-Pa-Pa-Paper, please!"
499286254396010496,2014-08-12 20:08:13,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
499271133372239872,2014-08-12 19:08:08,You played the Inverted Song of Time!
499256036415373312,2014-08-12 18:08:09,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
499240911759351808,2014-08-12 17:08:03,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
499225843470577666,2014-08-12 16:08:10,It's a Hiploop. Quickly dodge it if it charges at you. But can't you first do something about that mask it's wearing?
499210725126971394,2014-08-12 15:08:06,No using masks in the store because of past indiscretions!
499195730876043264,2014-08-12 14:08:31,"If you don't have a bow, you can't play."
499180582308294657,2014-08-12 13:08:19,Well...could you see it? It already may be impossible to stop its descent...
499165499779862528,2014-08-12 12:08:23,Please enjoy the Carnival of Time.
499150410024628224,2014-08-12 11:08:26,Play after me.
499135278875832320,2014-08-12 10:08:18,"It's Jo, second of the four ghost sisters. Aim when she appears. Hurry! There's no time!"
499120177808543744,2014-08-12 09:08:18,You shall remember this song!
499105101353459712,2014-08-12 08:08:23,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
499089992010850304,2014-08-12 07:08:21,Eh-hee-hee...You have the same smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods...
499074896069001216,2014-08-12 06:08:22,This is a problem. You just can't come in and hang out in our room!
499059794871738370,2014-08-12 05:08:21,"Though you may not understand these grown-up matters, you should probably take the pendant to Anju, anyway."
499044693007556609,2014-08-12 04:08:21,"If you came here to go swimming, you should go somewhere else."
499029609829003264,2014-08-12 03:08:25,You bought back the Gilded Sword that was stolen from you!
499014565087047680,2014-08-12 02:08:38,That's Romani's Mask. Only adult customers can get that mask.
498999370197377024,2014-08-12 01:08:15,"Say, what are the townsfolk saying about that moon? It's bigger than before, isn't it?"
498984298934849536,2014-08-12 00:08:22,And they say the world is a hard place. Look at you! I'd say you're pretty lucky!
498969208747589632,2014-08-11 23:08:24,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
498954047735345153,2014-08-11 22:08:09,No way! No Scrubs!
498938940947038208,2014-08-11 21:08:08,Those inssside... Our friendsss... Brrrriiiiinnnng them!

498908735855529984,2014-08-11 19:08:06,You found all the Stray Fairies! Quick! Take them to their fellow fairies of the same color!
498893656024047616,2014-08-11 18:08:11,"This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy Racetrack, just like the sign says."
498878534622781443,2014-08-11 17:08:06,Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon. Hurry... The four who are there... Bring them here...
498863448524984321,2014-08-11 16:08:09,"Oh, kind young one! Please find the fairies trapped in Great Bay Temple."
498848355519172608,2014-08-11 15:08:10,"It's Jo, second of the four ghost sisters. Aim when she appears. Hurry! There's no time!"
498833327957094401,2014-08-11 14:08:27,"If you're going to Great Bay, your timing is great. You should leave here as quickly as you can!"
498818248029118466,2014-08-11 13:08:32,You put a Zora Egg in a bottle! It doesn't look very healthy. You'd better have someone examine it quick!
498803128137830400,2014-08-11 12:08:27,"And just between you and me, the Skull Kid is no match for the Great Fairy."
498787998872252416,2014-08-11 11:08:20,"I am Dampe, the grave keeper, who watches over this graveyard. My face is frightening, but I am not a bad person!"
498772886048362496,2014-08-11 10:08:17,"This does the trick when you need energy, but you need an empty bottle to keep it in..."
498757774965084162,2014-08-11 09:08:14,"Are you, by chance, a boat cruise customer?"
498742699940265984,2014-08-11 08:08:20,"Waaah...Henh, uwaaaaah... Daaaaaddy, daaaddy...H-hunh... I'm cooold, Daaaddy!"
498727590882844672,2014-08-11 07:08:18,"When you wear it, you will transform into the shape you just were. When you remove it, you will return to normal."
498712483863863297,2014-08-11 06:08:16,"Even if it's just out of pure stubbornness, I'm going to keep the shop going..."
498697441382653952,2014-08-11 05:08:30,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
498682330173566977,2014-08-11 04:08:27,"I must hurry! The guest arriving in the afternoon will come. Skip this, skip that!"
498667248131653632,2014-08-11 03:08:31,I entered to win some concert tickets... Don't ya have anything to deliver to me?
498652269412249600,2014-08-11 02:09:00,I have a request! Kafei... I have a clue... that will help you find him.
498637064758243328,2014-08-11 01:08:35,No way! No Scrubs!
498621962705317888,2014-08-11 00:08:34,"This melody, lingering on the edges of your mind, is a song of memories of Princess Zelda."
498606855229157376,2014-08-10 23:08:32,"It is dangerous outside the town walls, so I cannot allow a child like you to... A sword?"
498591685643739136,2014-08-10 22:08:15,I made a reservation... The name is Link-goro!
498576560119504896,2014-08-10 21:08:09,Hullo. Did ya come to buy a Powder Keg?
498561567424643075,2014-08-10 20:08:35,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
498546381242372099,2014-08-10 19:08:14,You got the Fierce Deity's Mask! Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?
498531267894206464,2014-08-10 18:08:11,Sorry! Pretend you didn't hear that. My sister will get mad at me.
498516208308604930,2014-08-10 17:08:20,You played the Inverted Song of Time!
498501058667085825,2014-08-10 16:08:08,Strange... Isn't it? Getting a letter from a missing person...
498485944039665666,2014-08-10 15:08:05,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
498470914577530881,2014-08-10 14:08:21,"It seems the poison swamp has been cleaned up, so why not try something that's more interesting?"
498455779163127808,2014-08-10 13:08:13,"Welcome, Link... Allow me to ease your weariness."
498440689848315904,2014-08-10 12:08:15,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
498425604790710272,2014-08-10 11:08:19,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
498410504608432129,2014-08-10 10:08:18,"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?"
498395408993746945,2014-08-10 09:08:19,Grrrr... We're the notorious Gorman Brothers! We can't get all sappy over stuff like this!
498380318919757824,2014-08-10 08:08:22,"Ahh, I wanna find a girlfriend and get married soon, too..."
498365200085446657,2014-08-10 07:08:17,"Hee, hee! Now, that's a good look for you! You'll stay here looking that way forever!"
498350099718610944,2014-08-10 06:08:17,"It's a Wart. Once you've gotten rid of the spheres that shield the main body, you can attack the eye."
498335009980153856,2014-08-10 05:08:19,"That's a Real Bombchu! It runs at you with its pack of explosives, so protect yourself or else!"
498319904894754816,2014-08-10 04:08:18,"If you don't have a bow, you can't play."
498304808533499904,2014-08-10 03:08:19,Ooh! Ooh! Guess what! Lulu's voice... She's gotten it back!
498289737564573696,2014-08-10 02:08:25,We were about to punish an innocent monkey!
498259543080435712,2014-08-10 00:08:26,Buying two of the same thing won't do you any good.
498244446723379201,2014-08-09 23:08:27,"Huh? Do you mean you haven't been approved to carry Powder Kegs, yet?"
498229285610467328,2014-08-09 22:08:13,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
498214172635561984,2014-08-09 21:08:09,But Deku Scrubs are supposed to like rain. At least one of us has reason to be happy...
498199084134440960,2014-08-09 20:08:12,Whoa-ho-ho! Niiiice sideburns!
498183959314849792,2014-08-09 19:08:06,"What's this? Green clothes... White fairy... Sir, could you, by chance, be a forest fairy?"
498168902925291520,2014-08-09 18:08:16,"Stop right there, Deku Scrub!"
498153765141114880,2014-08-09 17:08:07,Hey...you don't have a bow. I can't sell you these! I kid you not!
498138685431230464,2014-08-09 16:08:12,"No, no, daddy-o! That song doesn't sing to my heart, baby!"
498123578898788352,2014-08-09 15:08:10,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you, or whatever."

498048130152009728,2014-08-09 10:08:22,Thanks for helping last night. The cows are doing well thanks to you. And they're putting out a lot of milk!
498033020599681024,2014-08-09 09:08:19,"Yeah, he's back, big brother."
498018025442787329,2014-08-09 08:08:44,"Ahh, I wanna find a girlfriend and get married soon, too..."
498002838618787840,2014-08-09 07:08:23,You got the Goron Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a proud Goron hero!
497987734246412288,2014-08-09 06:08:22,"Suddenly, memories of Princess Zelda come rushing back to you..."
497972645892087808,2014-08-09 05:08:25,"Accepting this keepsake doesn't make much sense to you, but you should take it anyway."
497957541125836800,2014-08-09 04:08:24,"This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy Racetrack, just like the sign says."

496372024869015552,2014-08-04 19:08:07,Don't tell me you don't know about the Deku Baba! Cut it down when it has extended its body and Deku Nuts or Sticks will come out.
496356942428651520,2014-08-04 18:08:11,But outside it seems to have gotten kind of...dangerous. Yikes... I'm gettin' outta town!

495601961513656322,2014-08-02 16:08:10,"Hey, Skull Kid, what if you gave that mask you're wearing back now?"
495586840288559104,2014-08-02 15:08:04,"From now on, be more aware of birds when you're strolling down the road..."
495571813154304000,2014-08-02 14:08:22,Huh? When did you get that instrument?!?
495556672308269057,2014-08-02 13:08:12,"Oh, man! I didn't think you'd come over here."
495541594611654656,2014-08-02 12:08:17,"If you could somehow step on top of that Octorok, I bet you'd be able to climb onto that central pillar."
495511397342523393,2014-08-02 10:08:17,Ooh! Ooh! Guess what! Lulu's voice... She's gotten it back!
495496295768133632,2014-08-02 09:08:17,"Hee, hee! Now, that's a good look for you! You'll stay here looking that way forever!"
495481213860077568,2014-08-02 08:08:21,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
495466108275544064,2014-08-02 07:08:20,You got the Zora Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a legendary guitarist!
495450999729819650,2014-08-02 06:08:18,"Hey, Skull Kid! Do you realize what you've been doing to everyone?!?"
495435908628221952,2014-08-02 05:08:20,It takes courage to come thieving in the Pirates' Fortress!
495420798694207488,2014-08-02 04:08:17,"Somehow, I feel as if I am once again racing with my son..."
495405707110268928,2014-08-02 03:08:19,See! Look at the moon... Leave town before the evacuation notice is made!
495390619733196800,2014-08-02 02:08:22,You bought back the Gilded Sword that was stolen from you!
495375489742036992,2014-08-02 01:08:15,You traded for the Largest Quiver! Now you can now hold up to 50 arrows!
495360428675829761,2014-08-02 00:08:24,"Why was the...? Why was the...? Why was the dog the leader?!? Was it 'cause something was wrong with me, sir???"
495345324886478848,2014-08-01 23:08:23,I made a reservation... The name is Link-goro!
495330169091919873,2014-08-01 22:08:09,"If you came here to go swimming, you should go somewhere else."
495315056129609728,2014-08-01 21:08:06,"You can't use any of them, but feel free to look around."
495300000662835200,2014-08-01 20:08:17,"It seems the poison swamp has been cleaned up, so why not try something that's more interesting?"
495284870097039360,2014-08-01 19:08:09,"Say, what are the townsfolk saying about that moon? It's bigger than before, isn't it?"
495269794384715780,2014-08-01 18:08:15,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
495254648005984256,2014-08-01 17:08:04,The moon has gotten so large! Quick! Take refuge as far away from town as you can!
495239573018902528,2014-08-01 16:08:09,"This isn't ""members-only,"" so take that thing off. I kid you not!"
495224462866784257,2014-08-01 15:08:07,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
495209430103781377,2014-08-01 14:08:23,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
495194321449013248,2014-08-01 13:08:21,Bremor! Don't be standin' 'round lookin' at yer feet all day!
495179203810033665,2014-08-01 12:08:16,"Is that so? Think it over, little guy!"
495164120371458048,2014-08-01 11:08:20,Ye who hold my remains... Return to the appointed place to face me...
495148997741256704,2014-08-01 10:08:15,But outside it seems to have gotten kind of...dangerous. Yikes... I'm gettin' outta town!
495133903204519938,2014-08-01 09:08:16,"If you could somehow step on top of that Octorok, I bet you'd be able to climb onto that central pillar."
495118824891375616,2014-08-01 08:08:21,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
495103717264220160,2014-08-01 07:08:19,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
495088605702795264,2014-08-01 06:08:16,"What?! Don't you know about the Skullwalltula? ... Just don't touch it, all right?"
495073516790628352,2014-08-01 05:08:19,"Returning to Snowhead, are you? It's dangerous at night, so be especially careful."
495058422958546944,2014-08-01 04:08:20,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"
495043323191517184,2014-08-01 03:08:20,Whaaat?!? You're really gonna give me that much? You're one rich little guy!
495028231628541952,2014-08-01 02:08:22,I'm sorry. We're totally booked with reservations. Please tell that to your mother.
495013102270701569,2014-08-01 01:08:15,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
494998036511092738,2014-08-01 00:08:23,"I wanna be one when I grow up, too."
494982948647497728,2014-07-31 23:08:25,"Heyyy! You don't have that much! You shouldn't lie to people! And you can take that to the bank, mister!"
494967777770217472,2014-07-31 22:08:08,I'll be on vacation for a short while. Please don't look for me.
494952669027385344,2014-07-31 21:08:06,"Suddenly, memories of Princess Zelda come rushing back to you..."
494937585374871554,2014-07-31 20:08:10,I made a reservation... The name is Link-goro!
494922467467460608,2014-07-31 19:08:06,I hate it! I hate it! I wanna see it! I wanna see it! I wanna see the race!
494907394279735296,2014-07-31 18:08:12,Hey...you don't have a bow. I can't sell you these! I kid you not!
494892273759309824,2014-07-31 17:08:07,I...I shall consume. Consume...Consume everything.
494877184721297408,2014-07-31 16:08:09,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
494862067388526595,2014-07-31 15:08:05,"Say, what are the townsfolk saying about that moon? It's bigger than before, isn't it?"
494847040455581696,2014-07-31 14:08:22,"It's a Desbreko. Once it bites you, it's not gonna want to let go. I haaaate this thing!"
494831910292451328,2014-07-31 13:08:15,"That's a Real Bombchu! It runs at you with its pack of explosives, so protect yourself or else!"
494816825448747010,2014-07-31 12:08:19,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
494801738281398272,2014-07-31 11:08:22,But Deku Scrubs are supposed to like rain. At least one of us has reason to be happy...
494786614342610946,2014-07-31 10:08:16,You got a Bomb Bag! Now you can carry and use bombs!
494771526407704577,2014-07-31 09:08:18,Shut up. I'm busy right now...
494756469338677250,2014-07-31 08:08:29,Ahhh... Nice weather...Isn't it?
494741338244386816,2014-07-31 07:08:21,"Oh, sorry. That's too bad. In that case, let me hear a song written by you, baby!"
494726253400694784,2014-07-31 06:08:25,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
494711160852058112,2014-07-31 05:08:26,Ye who hold my remains... Return to the appointed place to face me...
494696036070195200,2014-07-31 04:08:20,"It's strange, but the way you look right now sort of looks like this tree..."
494680981547151360,2014-07-31 03:08:31,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
494665913396776961,2014-07-31 02:08:38,"Accepting this keepsake doesn't make much sense to you, but you should take it anyway."
494635652713959430,2014-07-31 00:08:24,You got the Fierce Deity's Mask! Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?
494620595674312704,2014-07-30 23:08:34,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"
494605410217644032,2014-07-30 22:08:13,Are you suggesting that my instructions will put you to sleep? How rude! Be gone!
494590297339211777,2014-07-30 21:08:10,I...I shall consume. Consume...Consume everything.
494575215783837696,2014-07-30 20:08:14,I have a request! Kafei... I have a clue... that will help you find him.
494560086581207040,2014-07-30 19:08:07,"Ahh, I wanna find a girlfriend and get married soon, too..."
494545005688549376,2014-07-30 18:08:12,"OK, it's closing time. Quick! Get outta here!"
494529886300540930,2014-07-30 17:08:07,Ahhh... Nice weather...Isn't it?
494514796830527488,2014-07-30 16:08:09,Please enjoy the Carnival of Time.
494499687282393088,2014-07-30 15:08:07,Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone and attracted some weirdo's attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.
494484669753065474,2014-07-30 14:08:27,Ooh! Ooh! Guess what! Lulu's voice... She's gotten it back!
494469539195662338,2014-07-30 13:08:19,Don't tell me you don't know about the Deku Baba! Cut it down when it has extended its body and Deku Nuts or Sticks will come out.
494454455052427265,2014-07-30 12:08:23,"Oh, yeah...and, um... The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!"
494439374482722818,2014-07-30 11:08:27,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
494424242021076994,2014-07-30 10:08:19,"Oh, kind young one! Please find the fairies trapped in Great Bay Temple."
494409154342027265,2014-07-30 09:08:22,"From now on, be more aware of birds when you're strolling down the road..."
494394097252048896,2014-07-30 08:08:32,Your notes echoed far... but nothing happened.
494378955244183552,2014-07-30 07:08:22,"That melody's bogus, man!"
494363858748715008,2014-07-30 06:08:23,Have you been to the Clock Tower plaza yet?
494348771157749760,2014-07-30 05:08:26,You managed to figure out a code that only we know! Now that's something! I like you!
494333672854528002,2014-07-30 04:08:26,You too can master it! Seek out troubled individuals and lend an ear!
494318572185718786,2014-07-30 03:08:26,This is a problem. You just can't come in and hang out in our room!
494303538890035200,2014-07-30 02:08:42,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
494288354716811264,2014-07-30 01:08:21,I don't need that weird mask!
494273262478565376,2014-07-30 00:08:23,"Oh, yeah...and, um... The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!"
494258164821274624,2014-07-29 23:08:24,"Say, what are the townsfolk saying about that moon? It's bigger than before, isn't it?"
494243017675403264,2014-07-29 22:08:12,"Upon impact, it makes a blinding flash, freezing enemies in their tracks!"
494227920362024962,2014-07-29 21:08:13,You got a Magic Jar! Your magic power is replenished!
494212835518316544,2014-07-29 20:08:16,You cannot proceed any further through time...
494197705661370368,2014-07-29 19:08:09,Open your ears and listen hard!
494182617525149698,2014-07-29 18:08:12,"It's strange, but the way you look right now sort of looks like this tree..."
494167493980594177,2014-07-29 17:08:06,"Though you may not understand these grown-up matters, you should probably take the pendant to Anju, anyway."
494152460655542275,2014-07-29 16:08:22,"Are you, by chance, a boat cruise customer?"
494137299836227586,2014-07-29 15:08:07,You traded the Moon's Tear for a Land Title Deed!
494122299834920960,2014-07-29 14:08:31,What do you want? Don't look down at me! Adults shouldn't mess with kids' games!
494107157546037252,2014-07-29 13:08:21,"Certainly, he had far too many weaknesses to use my power."
494092065555230721,2014-07-29 12:08:22,"You got the Bunny Hood! My, what long ears it has! Will the power of the wild spring forth?"
494076976181678083,2014-07-29 11:08:25,"This is the room of Evan, the leader of the Zora Band, The Indigo-Go's."
494061851777323009,2014-07-29 10:08:19,Strange... Isn't it? Getting a letter from a missing person...
494046762798034946,2014-07-29 09:08:21,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
494031685894557696,2014-07-29 08:08:27,That's Romani's Mask. Only adult customers can get that mask.
494016557052207106,2014-07-29 07:08:20,Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone and attracted some weirdo's attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.
494001449336963073,2014-07-29 06:08:18,Shut up. I'm busy right now...
493986357702696960,2014-07-29 05:08:20,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
493971280744288257,2014-07-29 04:08:25,I made a reservation... The name is Link-goro!
493956160920113152,2014-07-29 03:08:20,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
493941084049784832,2014-07-29 02:08:26,"This melody, lingering on the edges of your mind, is a song of memories of Princess Zelda."
493925934739640321,2014-07-29 01:08:14,It's a Hiploop. Quickly dodge it if it charges at you. But can't you first do something about that mask it's wearing?
493910881428725760,2014-07-29 00:08:25,We were about to punish an innocent monkey!
493895793049206784,2014-07-28 23:08:27,You too can master it! Seek out troubled individuals and lend an ear!
493880630896119808,2014-07-28 22:08:12,Thanks for helping last night. The cows are doing well thanks to you. And they're putting out a lot of milk!
493865525508718592,2014-07-28 21:08:11,You got the Goron Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a proud Goron hero!
493850430032453632,2014-07-28 20:08:12,Oh! Darmani! I've been waiting impatiently for you.
493835307742007297,2014-07-28 19:08:07,"Yeah, he's back, big brother."
493820234025820162,2014-07-28 18:08:13,The ghosts of a hundred soldiers swear allegiance to this symbol of authority.
493805112683278337,2014-07-28 17:08:07,"If you came here to go swimming, you should go somewhere else."
493790031253757952,2014-07-28 16:08:12,Huh? When did you get that instrument?!?
493774912008384516,2014-07-28 15:08:07,Oh my? The Couple's Mask? Someone got married.
493759888565088256,2014-07-28 14:08:25,What's this? You've already saved up 5000 Rupees?!
493744804421857280,2014-07-28 13:08:29,Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon. Hurry... The four who are there... Bring them here...
493718107966279680,2014-07-28 11:22:24,"If people hear the great pirates have lost the treasure they stole, we'll become the laughing stock!"
493699701955244033,2014-07-28 10:09:16,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
493689146842431489,2014-07-28 09:27:19,That ill-mannered troublemaker from the other day said he'd break my instruments...
493673151293698048,2014-07-28 08:23:45,"I'm sure it was because he was always playing tricks, so nobody wanted to play with him."
493654366054658049,2014-07-28 07:09:07,"This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy Racetrack, just like the sign says."
493639264018505729,2014-07-28 06:09:06,"Hey, guy! You haven't passed my test, so how do you know my secret code?"
493627217159528449,2014-07-28 05:21:14,Return the flow of time to normal?
493611550477783041,2014-07-28 04:18:59,The drink even boosts your magic stamina! Swirl it around with your tongue to enjoy its flavor to the fullest!
493594228203593728,2014-07-28 03:10:09,You played the Inverted Song of Time!
493578827772481536,2014-07-28 02:08:57,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."
493563638821560321,2014-07-28 01:08:36,"This isn't ""members-only,"" so take that thing off. I kid you not!"
493548536475045889,2014-07-28 00:08:35,"It's a White Boe... Just calm down and attack it! Yeah, yeah, yeah... There are just a lot of them, OK?"
493533442856849411,2014-07-27 23:08:36,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
493518285392969731,2014-07-27 22:08:23,"Is that so? Think it over, little guy!"
493503167238127616,2014-07-27 21:08:18,"We offer our customers limited-run milk. Thus, we are a members-only establishment."
493472923319939072,2014-07-27 19:08:07,"That's a Real Bombchu! It runs at you with its pack of explosives, so protect yourself or else!"
493457844767707137,2014-07-27 18:08:12,"So, please, give me that which you promised me... Don't tell me... My mask... You did... get it back...Didn't you?"
493442714575200256,2014-07-27 17:08:05,Whoa!!! Look at the time! You don't even have a single day left!
493427652514967553,2014-07-27 16:08:14,No way! No Scrubs!
493412526332211202,2014-07-27 15:08:08,"You're not thinking I'm stealing your song, do you?"
493397527941509120,2014-07-27 14:08:32,Open your ears and listen hard!
493382362143522816,2014-07-27 13:08:16,"It's a Gibdo. You won't be able to move if it glares at you, so be careful!"
493367274703572992,2014-07-27 12:08:19,"Ah! That stone! You must hand it over to me! In exchange, I'll give you my spot here... Deku Flower included!"
493337092471017473,2014-07-27 10:08:23,I have a request! Kafei... I have a clue... that will help you find him.
493291776417865728,2014-07-27 07:08:19,It's true! Surely the great Darmani can do something about the blizzard that blows in from Snowhead.
493276695068037125,2014-07-27 06:08:23,"Oh, the Circus Leader's Mask! He comes here a lot."
493261658588839937,2014-07-27 05:08:38,That ill-mannered troublemaker from the other day said he'd break my instruments...
493246497207500800,2014-07-27 04:08:23,"I hear some ghosts or something appeared at Romani Ranch yesterday, and now all their cows are gone."
493231400435191809,2014-07-27 03:08:24,"Somehow, I feel as if I am once again racing with my son..."
493216319727087617,2014-07-27 02:08:28,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
493201199798431744,2014-07-27 01:08:23,What do you want? Don't look down at me! Adults shouldn't mess with kids' games!
493186107073232896,2014-07-27 00:08:25,This is the Bombers' Notebook. It contains the words we live by! Read it over!
493171033524809728,2014-07-26 23:08:31,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
493155855219449856,2014-07-26 22:08:12,"This isn't ""members-only,"" so take that thing off. I kid you not!"
493140752810004481,2014-07-26 21:08:12,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
493125669761470465,2014-07-26 20:08:16,"We have all been expecting your next order, sir."
493110552537743360,2014-07-26 19:08:11,W-What just happened?! Everything has... started over...
493095465064214529,2014-07-26 18:08:14,"If it's possible, put the scent in something and take it to the Magic Hags' Potion Shop."
493080341066706944,2014-07-26 17:08:08,Open your ears and listen hard!
493065262107590656,2014-07-26 16:08:13,"Oh, it was the fairy's light. In that case, it's just perfect."
493050154371407872,2014-07-26 15:08:11,Your defense has been strengthened! Enemies now do half as much damage as before!
493035101572198402,2014-07-26 14:08:23,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
493019963985113088,2014-07-26 13:08:13,"That melody's bogus, man!"
493004879497920512,2014-07-26 12:08:17,"What's this? Green clothes... White fairy... Sir, could you, by chance, be a forest fairy?"
492989805282603008,2014-07-26 11:08:23,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
492974683923292160,2014-07-26 10:08:18,"What?! Don't you know about the Skullwalltula? ... Just don't touch it, all right?"
492959585448099840,2014-07-26 09:08:18,"Ohh, how adorable! Let me tug on your long ears. If you study the way of the sword here, you'll get your bunny dirty, so put it away."
492944509882204160,2014-07-26 08:08:24,"Returning to Snowhead, are you? It's dangerous at night, so be especially careful."
492929382155956224,2014-07-26 07:08:17,"This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy Racetrack, just like the sign says."
492914292413329409,2014-07-26 06:08:19,The horse seems to like this song.
492899189861253120,2014-07-26 05:08:19,"Do you already have bombs, the special product of the Gorons?"
492884091499327488,2014-07-26 04:08:19,Will you buy one of Tingle's maps?
492868993464561664,2014-07-26 03:08:19,"Even if it's just out of pure stubbornness, I'm going to keep the shop going..."
492838771126063104,2014-07-26 01:08:14,"I am Dampe, the grave keeper, who watches over this graveyard. My face is frightening, but I am not a bad person!"
492823706750558208,2014-07-26 00:08:22,Are you suggesting that my instructions will put you to sleep? How rude! Be gone!
492808620032028673,2014-07-25 23:08:25,"That melody's bogus, man!"
492793456066953216,2014-07-25 22:08:10,Aw! No way! You finally got me!
492778345923219456,2014-07-25 21:08:07,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
492763263235411968,2014-07-25 20:08:11,"(Translation) I am disappointed, oh moon. I have died!"
492748125862248448,2014-07-25 19:08:02,Be careful... I sense a lot of evil here.
492733074099036160,2014-07-25 18:08:14,I made a reservation... The name is Link-goro!
492717938240024576,2014-07-25 17:08:05,"Stop right there, Deku Scrub!"
492702856869187584,2014-07-25 16:08:09,Well...could you see it? It already may be impossible to stop its descent...
492687744368267266,2014-07-25 15:08:06,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you or whatever."
492672709428404225,2014-07-25 14:08:22,No using masks in the store because of past indiscretions!
492657576446660609,2014-07-25 13:08:14,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you, or whatever."
492642493016465408,2014-07-25 12:08:17,"Yeah, he's back, big brother."
492627421552578561,2014-07-25 11:08:24,Huh? The moon? It's gotten bigger again. Th-this is bad...
492597204087865344,2014-07-25 09:08:20,Shut up. I'm busy right now...
492582117675511808,2014-07-25 08:08:23,"Upon impact, it makes a blinding flash, freezing enemies in their tracks!"
492567003496857600,2014-07-25 07:08:19,"That's a Real Bombchu! It runs at you with its pack of explosives, so protect yourself or else!"
492551909308264448,2014-07-25 06:08:21,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
492536804164128768,2014-07-25 05:08:19,You cannot proceed any further through time...
492506609843580930,2014-07-25 03:08:20,"I'm sure it was because he was always playing tricks, so nobody wanted to play with him."
492491533682081793,2014-07-25 02:08:26,"This does the trick when you need energy, but you need an empty bottle to keep it in..."
492476398318022656,2014-07-25 01:08:17,What's that?!? The Skull Kid got to Koume?!?
492461325822332928,2014-07-25 00:08:24,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
492446285660958720,2014-07-24 23:08:38,W-What just happened?! Everything has... started over...
492431102406320128,2014-07-24 22:08:18,"Oh, kind young one! Please find the fairies trapped in Great Bay Temple."
492415960863604736,2014-07-24 21:08:08,Well...could you see it? It already may be impossible to stop its descent...

492355554824581120,2014-07-24 17:08:06,"It is dangerous outside the town walls, so I cannot allow a child like you to... A sword?"
492340475936796672,2014-07-24 16:08:11,"Ohh, how adorable! Let me tug on your long ears. If you study the way of the sword here, you'll get your bunny dirty, so put it away."
492325354543910912,2014-07-24 15:08:06,"With black roses etched into it, the Great Fairy's Sword is the most powerful of all blades."
492310318312206338,2014-07-24 14:08:21,You got the Fierce Deity's Mask! Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?
492295187230511104,2014-07-24 13:08:13,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
492280110699925504,2014-07-24 12:08:19,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
492265025369690113,2014-07-24 11:08:22,Open your ears and listen hard!
492249904199114753,2014-07-24 10:08:17,"You got the Bunny Hood! My, what long ears it has! Will the power of the wild spring forth?"
492234802976653312,2014-07-24 09:08:16,Play after me.
492219727301734400,2014-07-24 08:08:22,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
492204615736111105,2014-07-24 07:08:19,This is a problem. You just can't come in and hang out in our room!
492189513679003648,2014-07-24 06:08:19,You got the Goron Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a proud Goron hero!
492174419796578304,2014-07-24 05:08:20,You caught a Big Poe in a bottle! This may lead to something good...
492159305735364609,2014-07-24 04:08:17,Night of the Final Day. 12 Hours Remain
492144229359964160,2014-07-24 03:08:22,"Ye who hold the sacred sword, leave proof of our encounter."
492129151843704833,2014-07-24 02:08:27,"So, please, give me that which you promised me... Don't tell me... My mask... You did... get it back...Didn't you?"
492114010620174337,2014-07-24 01:08:17,"Oh, man! I didn't think you'd come over here."
492098972723318784,2014-07-24 00:08:32,All right! That Skull Kid broke our rules and he's been doing all kinds of bad things lately.
492083860234985473,2014-07-23 23:08:29,"You can't use any of them, but feel free to look around."
492068685989679104,2014-07-23 22:08:11,Ye who hold my remains... Return to the appointed place to face me...
492053567742541824,2014-07-23 21:08:07,"Welcome, Link... Allow me to ease your weariness."

492023362550378497,2014-07-23 19:08:05,"You got Don Gero's Mask! It looks just like Don Gero, conductor of the frog choir!"
492008281741598721,2014-07-23 18:08:10,"I bet if you had a weapon that was strong enough, one shot from it could pierce right through this!"
491993157622460417,2014-07-23 17:08:04,Aw! No way! You finally got me!
491978096640147457,2014-07-23 16:08:13,"If you could somehow step on top of that Octorok, I bet you'd be able to climb onto that central pillar."
491962976224571392,2014-07-23 15:08:08,"Oh, yeah! How was it? It went by in an instant, right? I'm still full of energy!"

491887550613557248,2014-07-23 10:08:25,"Are you, by chance, a boat cruise customer?"
491872424346931200,2014-07-23 09:08:19,"Hey, guy! You haven't passed my test, so how do you know my secret code?"
491857345547223040,2014-07-23 08:08:24,"Pa-Pa-Pa-Paper, please!"
491842226972938240,2014-07-23 07:08:19,"They fall from what looks to be the moon's eye, so I call them Moon's Tears."
491827139600084992,2014-07-23 06:08:22,Have you been to the Clock Tower plaza yet?
491812038499246080,2014-07-23 05:08:22,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
491796922781294593,2014-07-23 04:08:18,You got the Keaton Mask! This is Kafei's mask of memories.
491781841544675328,2014-07-23 03:08:22,"It's strange, but the way you look right now sort of looks like this tree..."
491766739613401089,2014-07-23 02:08:21,"If people hear the great pirates have lost the treasure they stole, we'll become the laughing stock!"
491751632586043394,2014-07-23 01:08:20,"100 steps north, 100 steps south, 100 steps east, 100 steps west. The spot at which those giants parted is right in the middle of this town."
491736547041878016,2014-07-23 00:08:23,Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon. Hurry... The four who are there... Bring them here...
491721464974815232,2014-07-22 23:08:27,You learned the Lullaby Intro! The soothing melody of a thoughtful father.
491706298891657216,2014-07-22 22:08:11,We were about to punish an innocent monkey!
491691186864652288,2014-07-22 21:08:08,But outside it seems to have gotten kind of...dangerous. Yikes... I'm gettin' outta town!
491676103749009408,2014-07-22 20:08:12,"Oh, kind young one! Please find the fairies trapped in Great Bay Temple."

491630778850111488,2014-07-22 17:08:06,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."

491525151289143296,2014-07-22 10:08:22,"Umm, Mommy... Don't go picking up bomb bags in the middle of the night anymore."
491510060976054272,2014-07-22 09:08:25,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.

491449670128779264,2014-07-22 05:08:26,W-What just happened?! Everything has... started over...
491434547142094849,2014-07-22 04:08:21,"But something has to be done about this cold. Otherwise, we'll be Goronsicles."
491419461576966144,2014-07-22 03:08:24,"And just between you and me, the Skull Kid is no match for the Great Fairy."
491404376171220992,2014-07-22 02:08:27,"That's a Real Bombchu! It runs at you with its pack of explosives, so protect yourself or else!"
491389238328320000,2014-07-22 01:08:18,"It's a Gibdo. You won't be able to move if it glares at you, so be careful!"
491374182693744640,2014-07-22 00:08:29,"Man, I just work here part-time, so I don't really know this stuff."
491359088995885056,2014-07-21 23:08:30,I'm sorry. We're totally booked with reservations. Please tell that to your mother.
491343908828225536,2014-07-21 22:08:11,It looks like the lady is taking a break. Let's not bother her.
491328802027368448,2014-07-21 21:08:09,Will you buy one of Tingle's maps?
491313714625146880,2014-07-21 20:08:12,"You got Don Gero's Mask! It looks just like Don Gero, conductor of the frog choir!"
491298593660084224,2014-07-21 19:08:07,Return the flow of time to normal?
491283515669889024,2014-07-21 18:08:12,The ghosts of a hundred soldiers swear allegiance to this symbol of authority.
491268387373187072,2014-07-21 17:08:05,You too can master it! Seek out troubled individuals and lend an ear!
491253311413026816,2014-07-21 16:08:11,What do you want? Don't look down at me! Adults shouldn't mess with kids' games!
491238201520967680,2014-07-21 15:08:08,"This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy Racetrack, just like the sign says."
491223173115805697,2014-07-21 14:08:25,I'll be on vacation for a short while. Please don't look for me.
491208035407126529,2014-07-21 13:08:16,Whoa-ho-ho! Niiiice sideburns!
491192950706036736,2014-07-21 12:08:20,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
491177868731248641,2014-07-21 11:08:24,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
491162746839265280,2014-07-21 10:08:18,You found all the Stray Fairies! Quick! Take them to their fellow fairies of the same color!
491147652378021888,2014-07-21 09:08:20,"Oh, yeah! How was it? It went by in an instant, right? I'm still full of energy!"
491132563038040064,2014-07-21 08:08:22,"Look, I'd like you to buy my bomb, too, but it's just too heavy for you to carry. Sorry."
491117459454164993,2014-07-21 07:08:21,You got the Boss Key! Now you can enter the chamber where the boss lurks!
491102349461422080,2014-07-21 06:08:19,"You can't use any of them, but feel free to look around."
491087278123388928,2014-07-21 05:08:25,"It's a Gibdo. You won't be able to move if it glares at you, so be careful!"
491072197599825922,2014-07-21 04:08:30,Shut up. I'm busy right now...
491057061698875392,2014-07-21 03:08:21,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
491042002050371584,2014-07-21 02:08:31,I'm sorry. We're totally booked with reservations. Please tell that to your mother.
491026842174750721,2014-07-21 01:08:16,"Somehow, I feel as if I am once again racing with my son..."
491011781775482881,2014-07-21 00:08:25,Thank you for returning my broken and shattered body to normal.
490996690720018432,2014-07-20 23:08:28,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
490981521658880001,2014-07-20 22:08:11,Thanks for helping last night. The cows are doing well thanks to you. And they're putting out a lot of milk!
490966407429894144,2014-07-20 21:08:07,"Huh? Do you mean you haven't been approved to carry Powder Kegs, yet?"
490951321554411520,2014-07-20 20:08:11,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
490906002758193152,2014-07-20 17:08:06,Huh? When did you get that instrument?!?
490890922456915968,2014-07-20 16:08:10,Return the flow of time to normal?
490875814238363649,2014-07-20 15:08:08,Ho! Ho! I hear it's gonna fall harder than the way my clumsy brother is always dropping our juggling balls!
490860815327559683,2014-07-20 14:08:32,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
490845672283713536,2014-07-20 13:08:22,We were about to punish an innocent monkey!
490830587461005313,2014-07-20 12:08:25,I'm terribly sorry. There are no vacancies today...We're booked solid with reservations.
490815759564558336,2014-07-20 11:09:30,That ill-mannered troublemaker from the other day said he'd break my instruments...
490800448450732032,2014-07-20 10:08:40,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
490785327598952449,2014-07-20 09:08:35,"I'm sure it was because he was always playing tricks, so nobody wanted to play with him."
490770224887513089,2014-07-20 08:08:34,"I must hurry! The guest arriving in the afternoon will come. Skip this, skip that!"
490755135958556672,2014-07-20 07:08:36,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
490740086460256256,2014-07-20 06:08:48,"It's Jo, second of the four ghost sisters. Aim when she appears. Hurry! There's no time!"
490724919726985216,2014-07-20 05:08:32,Don't tell me you don't know about the Deku Baba! Cut it down when it has extended its body and Deku Nuts or Sticks will come out.
490709816348647424,2014-07-20 04:08:31,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.
490700077451587584,2014-07-20 03:29:49,I'll just teach you the beginning...
490680748299784193,2014-07-20 02:13:01,Well...could you see it? It already may be impossible to stop its descent...
490664695200612352,2014-07-20 01:09:14,"Oh, it was the fairy's light. In that case, it's just perfect."
490649420283662336,2014-07-20 00:08:32,Be careful... I sense a lot of evil here.
490634335863574528,2014-07-19 23:08:35,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
490619163145035776,2014-07-19 22:08:18,"(Translation) I am disappointed, oh moon. I have died!"
490604045095034880,2014-07-19 21:08:13,"Somehow, I feel as if I am once again racing with my son..."
490588991930908672,2014-07-19 20:08:25,Have you been to the Clock Tower plaza yet?
490573854608072704,2014-07-19 19:08:16,Thanks for helping last night. The cows are doing well thanks to you. And they're putting out a lot of milk!

they're all gorgeous."
490543613701398528,2014-07-19 17:08:06,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
490528535023325185,2014-07-19 16:08:10,"Even if it's just out of pure stubbornness, I'm going to keep the shop going..."
490513420219715585,2014-07-19 15:08:07,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.
490498389692276738,2014-07-19 14:08:23,"Welcome, Link... Allow me to ease your weariness."
490483244706443264,2014-07-19 13:08:12,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
490469333433208832,2014-07-19 12:12:56,Oh my? The Couple's Mask? Someone got married.
490447821766524928,2014-07-19 10:47:27,Thank you for returning my broken and shattered body to normal.
490430485982482433,2014-07-19 09:38:34,"If you leave my mask out there, something terrible will happen!"
490415367353692161,2014-07-19 08:38:29,"With black roses etched into it, the Great Fairy's Sword is the most powerful of all blades."
490400282002460674,2014-07-19 07:38:33,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."
490385136135835648,2014-07-19 06:38:22,It's a mystical song that allows you to shed a shell shaped in your current image.
490370097878269952,2014-07-19 05:38:36,"You have strange powers, no? Me been watching you!"
490354946710056960,2014-07-19 04:38:24,You played the Oath to Order!
490339872960290816,2014-07-19 03:38:30,"Upon impact, it makes a blinding flash, freezing enemies in their tracks!"
490324714502377472,2014-07-19 02:38:16,The mask that was stolen from me... It is called Majora's Mask.
490309626013835265,2014-07-19 01:38:19,"I am Dampe, the grave keeper, who watches over this graveyard. My face is frightening, but I am not a bad person!"
490294488661651457,2014-07-19 00:38:09,"If you could somehow step on top of that Octorok, I bet you'd be able to climb onto that central pillar."
490279420679057410,2014-07-18 23:38:17,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."

490249253604700161,2014-07-18 21:38:25,And they say the world is a hard place. Look at you! I'd say you're pretty lucky!
490234167049723904,2014-07-18 20:38:28,Leeeaave me something small and creepy!
490218998647115776,2014-07-18 19:38:11,Please enjoy the Carnival of Time.
490203882245480448,2014-07-18 18:38:07,"Say, what are the townsfolk saying about that moon? It's bigger than before, isn't it?"
490188802577534976,2014-07-18 17:38:12,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"
490173670048821248,2014-07-18 16:38:04,It looks like the lady is taking a break. Let's not bother her.

490068052243800064,2014-07-18 09:38:23,"If you play that strange song backwards, you can slow the flow of time."
490052920604254209,2014-07-18 08:38:15,Whoa!!! Look at the time! You don't even have a single day left!
490037822904999936,2014-07-18 07:38:16,The canyon at Stone Tower lies this way. Be careful.
490022690401447936,2014-07-18 06:38:08,I tell you...Tingle is the very reincarnation of a fairy!
490007624025243650,2014-07-18 05:38:16,"Are you, by chance, a boat cruise customer?"
489992496198336512,2014-07-18 04:38:09,"If you leave my mask out there, something terrible will happen!"
489977422817665024,2014-07-18 03:38:15,I have a request! Kafei... I have a clue... that will help you find him.
489962312946556928,2014-07-18 02:38:13,"Do you already have bombs, the special product of the Gorons?"
489947234067578881,2014-07-18 01:38:18,"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?"
489932104180826112,2014-07-18 00:38:10,"Hey, Skull Kid, what if you gave that mask you're wearing back now?"
489917032637296640,2014-07-17 23:38:17,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
489901895373160448,2014-07-17 22:38:08,What's that?!? The Skull Kid got to Koume?!?
489886812907655168,2014-07-17 21:38:12,Bremor! Don't be standin' 'round lookin' at yer feet all day!
489871719180414976,2014-07-17 20:38:13,"Hee, hee! Now, that's a good look for you! You'll stay here looking that way forever!"

489826409146105856,2014-07-17 17:38:11,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
489811288692781057,2014-07-17 16:38:06,"Ohh, how adorable! Let me tug on your long ears. If you study the way of the sword here, you'll get your bunny dirty, so put it away."
489796206902534144,2014-07-17 15:38:10,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
489781115876425728,2014-07-17 14:38:12,But Deku Scrubs are supposed to like rain. At least one of us has reason to be happy...
489766022627356672,2014-07-17 13:38:13,Oh! Darmani! I've been waiting impatiently for you.
489750907488186368,2014-07-17 12:38:10,I'll be on vacation for a short while. Please don't look for me.
489735858220572672,2014-07-17 11:38:22,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!

489705624498733057,2014-07-17 09:38:13,I don't need that weird mask!
489690528091340801,2014-07-17 08:38:14,"Hey, Skull Kid, what if you gave that mask you're wearing back now?"
489675421751840768,2014-07-17 07:38:12,The mask that was stolen from me... It is called Majora's Mask.
489660305429897217,2014-07-17 06:38:08,"This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy Racetrack, just like the sign says."
489645222666588160,2014-07-17 05:38:12,Eh-hee-hee...You have the same smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods...
489630110148866048,2014-07-17 04:38:09,You played the Oath to Order!
489615023975571456,2014-07-17 03:38:12,"I wanna be one when I grow up, too."
489599927261999104,2014-07-17 02:38:13,"My sister Romani has been worried, too. She's practicing using a bow... She says it's to stop the ""ghosts."""
489584866351001601,2014-07-17 01:38:22,You did it! You helped Cremia! You feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Sigh... You could get used to this!
489569725194588160,2014-07-17 00:38:12,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
489554641932128257,2014-07-16 23:38:16,You got the Fierce Deity's Mask! Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?
489539510313558017,2014-07-16 22:38:09,"Do you already have bombs, the special product of the Gorons?"
489524527508893696,2014-07-16 21:38:36,"Oh, it was the fairy's light. In that case, it's just perfect."
489509341762822144,2014-07-16 20:38:16,You got the Goron Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a proud Goron hero!
489494263454236672,2014-07-16 19:38:21,Hullo. Did ya come to buy a Powder Keg?
489479144087224322,2014-07-16 18:38:16,Oh! Darmani! I've been waiting impatiently for you.
489464028511494144,2014-07-16 17:38:12,"We have all been expecting your next order, sir."
489433832848756736,2014-07-16 15:38:13,"I'm sure it was because he was always playing tricks, so nobody wanted to play with him."
489418730124767232,2014-07-16 14:38:12,"Zero Rupees? Oh, that's a cruel joke!"
489403655120896000,2014-07-16 13:38:18,"But something has to be done about this cold. Otherwise, we'll be Goronsicles."
489388516804001793,2014-07-16 12:38:09,Your defense has been strengthened! Enemies now do half as much damage as before!
489373459575631872,2014-07-16 11:38:19,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
489358326942023683,2014-07-16 10:38:11,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
489343252063981568,2014-07-16 09:38:17,Ahhh... Nice weather...Isn't it?
489328158919774208,2014-07-16 08:38:19,This is a problem. You just can't come in and hang out in our room!
489313040764903424,2014-07-16 07:38:14,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
489297926779195392,2014-07-16 06:38:11,"Oh, the Circus Leader's Mask! He comes here a lot."
489282857123078145,2014-07-16 05:38:18,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
489267724615303168,2014-07-16 04:38:10,Strange... Isn't it? Getting a letter from a missing person...
489252683111362560,2014-07-16 03:38:24,You got a Magic Jar! Your magic power is replenished!
489237555573829633,2014-07-16 02:38:17,Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone and attracted some weirdo's attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.
489207342769008640,2014-07-16 00:38:14,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."
489192265630240768,2014-07-15 23:38:19,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
489177135097970689,2014-07-15 22:38:12,Have you been to the Clock Tower plaza yet?
489162059146207232,2014-07-15 21:38:17,"If you came here to go swimming, you should go somewhere else."
489146950860537856,2014-07-15 20:38:15,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
489131856051179521,2014-07-15 19:38:16,We shouldn't change the song now... Guru-Guru is scary when he gets mad...
489116756972027904,2014-07-15 18:38:16,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you or whatever."
489101733205778432,2014-07-15 17:38:34,Ye who hold my remains... Return to the appointed place to face me...
489071510779203584,2014-07-15 15:38:29,"They fall from what looks to be the moon's eye, so I call them Moon's Tears."
489056410580156416,2014-07-15 14:38:29,"I wanna be one when I grow up, too."
489041325518376961,2014-07-15 13:38:32,"If you could somehow step on top of that Octorok, I bet you'd be able to climb onto that central pillar."
489026168125804544,2014-07-15 12:38:18,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
489011102303281152,2014-07-15 11:38:26,I don't need that weird mask!
488995971380940801,2014-07-15 10:38:19,Eh-hee-hee...You have the same smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods...
488980907395514369,2014-07-15 09:38:27,You bought back the Gilded Sword that was stolen from you!
488965797826408448,2014-07-15 08:38:25,"My sister Romani has been worried, too. She's practicing using a bow... She says it's to stop the ""ghosts."""
488950704992567297,2014-07-15 07:38:26,"But something has to be done about this cold. Otherwise, we'll be Goronsicles."
488935540557766656,2014-07-15 06:38:11,Whoa-ho-ho! Niiiice sideburns!
488920492393234434,2014-07-15 05:38:23,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
488905339295641600,2014-07-15 04:38:10,Oh... You've collected some nice masks!
488890344155516928,2014-07-15 03:38:35,"You got the Bremen Mask! This mask belonged to the leader  of the animal troupe. Try parading it around tiny, young animals."
488875173349560321,2014-07-15 02:38:18,I'm terribly sorry. There are no vacancies today...We're booked solid with reservations.
488860281859100673,2014-07-15 01:39:08,"Oh my, what are you doing to my dogs? Put the dog down and step away from the kennel!"
488844974931210240,2014-07-15 00:38:18,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
488829865978634240,2014-07-14 23:38:16,I...I shall consume. Consume...Consume everything.
488814727112310784,2014-07-14 22:38:07,What's this? You've already saved up 5000 Rupees?!
488799687948791808,2014-07-14 21:38:21,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
488784634210050048,2014-07-14 20:38:32,I'm sorry. We're totally booked with reservations. Please tell that to your mother.
488769502335610880,2014-07-14 19:38:24,"That's a Real Bombchu! It runs at you with its pack of explosives, so protect yourself or else!"
488754328908201986,2014-07-14 18:38:07,"Zero Rupees? Oh, that's a cruel joke!"
488739250263707648,2014-07-14 17:38:12,You got a Silver Rupee! It's worth 100 Rupees! You're pretty happy!
488724130573713408,2014-07-14 16:38:07,You found all the Stray Fairies! Quick! Take them to their fellow fairies of the same color!
488709054106050560,2014-07-14 15:38:12,No using masks in the store because of past indiscretions!
488693956167749632,2014-07-14 14:38:13,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
488678859542253568,2014-07-14 13:38:14,But outside it seems to have gotten kind of...dangerous. Yikes... I'm gettin' outta town!
488663739604824065,2014-07-14 12:38:09,It takes courage to come thieving in the Pirates' Fortress!
488648676143685632,2014-07-14 11:38:17,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
488633544642551808,2014-07-14 10:38:10,"If it's possible, put the scent in something and take it to the Magic Hags' Potion Shop."
488618472696340480,2014-07-14 09:38:16,"Ye who hold the sacred sword, leave proof of our encounter."
488603372488908800,2014-07-14 08:38:16,What do you want? Don't look down at me! Adults shouldn't mess with kids' games!
488588275330727936,2014-07-14 07:38:17,You cannot proceed any further through time...
488573161055604736,2014-07-14 06:38:13,"No, no, daddy-o! That song doesn't sing to my heart, baby!"
488558081182154752,2014-07-14 05:38:18,Don't tell me you don't know about the Deku Baba! Cut it down when it has extended its body and Deku Nuts or Sticks will come out.
488542957876690944,2014-07-14 04:38:12,"Oh, yeah! How was it? It went by in an instant, right? I'm still full of energy!"
488527872928120832,2014-07-14 03:38:15,The horse seems to like this song.
488513017923923969,2014-07-14 02:39:14,Please enjoy the Carnival of Time.
488497695011504128,2014-07-14 01:38:21,"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?"
488482613007368192,2014-07-14 00:38:25,"I hear some ghosts or something appeared at Romani Ranch yesterday, and now all their cows are gone."
488467488460390400,2014-07-13 23:38:19,It looks like the lady is taking a break. Let's not bother her.
488452421996118016,2014-07-13 22:38:27,"That melody's bogus, man!"
488437364163739649,2014-07-13 21:38:37,Whoa!!! Look at the time! You don't even have a single day left!
488422240992497665,2014-07-13 20:38:31,Thank you for returning my broken and shattered body to normal.
488407134594273280,2014-07-13 19:38:29,"Hey, Skull Kid! Do you realize what you've been doing to everyone?!?"
488391952274960385,2014-07-13 18:38:09,Huh? The moon? It's gotten bigger again. Th-this is bad...
488376864444915712,2014-07-13 17:38:12,No way! No Scrubs!
488361732645990400,2014-07-13 16:38:05,"So, please, give me that which you promised me... Don't tell me... My mask... You did... get it back...Didn't you?"
488346679607693312,2014-07-13 15:38:16,I can tell you're not very used to your Deku Scrub body yet.
488331570890022912,2014-07-13 14:38:13,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
488316482095312896,2014-07-13 13:38:16,"Say, what are the townsfolk saying about that moon? It's bigger than before, isn't it?"
488286305273384961,2014-07-13 11:38:21,I...I shall consume. Consume...Consume everything.
488256093823315968,2014-07-13 09:38:18,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you or whatever."
488241111505199104,2014-07-13 08:38:46,"100 steps north, 100 steps south, 100 steps east, 100 steps west. The spot at which those giants parted is right in the middle of this town."
488225933229191168,2014-07-13 07:38:27,Oh my? The Couple's Mask? Someone got married.
488210823978831873,2014-07-13 06:38:25,Oh... You've collected some nice masks!
488195797985423361,2014-07-13 05:38:43,Ahhh... Nice weather...Isn't it?
488180593272692736,2014-07-13 04:38:18,"If you leave my mask out there, something terrible will happen!"
488165496638812160,2014-07-13 03:38:18,"They fall from what looks to be the moon's eye, so I call them Moon's Tears."
488150481609314306,2014-07-13 02:38:38,Huh? The moon? It's gotten bigger again. Th-this is bad...
488135360367456256,2014-07-13 01:38:33,You traded the Moon's Tear for a Land Title Deed!
488120290379956225,2014-07-13 00:38:40,I have a request! Kafei... I have a clue... that will help you find him.
488105125374726145,2014-07-12 23:38:25,Eh-hee-hee...You have the same smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods...
488089963439738880,2014-07-12 22:38:10,Be careful... I sense a lot of evil here.
488074887706079233,2014-07-12 21:38:15,Ye who hold my remains... Return to the appointed place to face me...
488059790505959425,2014-07-12 20:38:16,You bought back the Gilded Sword that was stolen from you!
488044704940843008,2014-07-12 19:38:19,Grrrr... We're the notorious Gorman Brothers! We can't get all sappy over stuff like this!
488029600274853888,2014-07-12 18:38:18,I don't need that weird mask!
488014494669357056,2014-07-12 17:38:17,I'll just teach you the beginning...
487999351663239168,2014-07-12 16:38:06,"I must hurry! The guest arriving in the afternoon will come. Skip this, skip that!"
487984311610527748,2014-07-12 15:38:20,"Certainly, he had far too many weaknesses to use my power."
487969218399203328,2014-07-12 14:38:22,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
487954123828903937,2014-07-12 13:38:23,Leeeaave me something small and creepy!
487939014020698112,2014-07-12 12:38:21,"Zero Rupees? Oh, that's a cruel joke!"

487863620353536000,2014-07-12 07:38:45,"It's a Desbreko. Once it bites you, it's not gonna want to let go. I haaaate this thing!"
487848399891206144,2014-07-12 06:38:16,Will you stop staring and just open that door for me?!?
487833348446769152,2014-07-12 05:38:28,"Oh, yeah! How was it? It went by in an instant, right? I'm still full of energy!"

487787981852254208,2014-07-12 02:38:12,I have a request! Kafei... I have a clue... that will help you find him.
487772925697605632,2014-07-12 01:38:22,We shouldn't change the song now... Guru-Guru is scary when he gets mad...
487757772037971968,2014-07-12 00:38:09,That's Romani's Mask. Only adult customers can get that mask.
487742703254269952,2014-07-11 23:38:16,You got the Fierce Deity's Mask! Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?
487712494241062912,2014-07-11 21:38:14,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"
487697384982327296,2014-07-11 20:38:12,"But something has to be done about this cold. Otherwise, we'll be Goronsicles."

487636963323682817,2014-07-11 16:38:06,I...I shall consume. Consume...Consume everything.
487621889162899458,2014-07-11 15:38:12,"Do you already have bombs, the special product of the Gorons?"
487606780629774336,2014-07-11 14:38:10,"You have strange powers, no? Me been watching you!"

487546367921750016,2014-07-11 10:38:06,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
487531287519850496,2014-07-11 09:38:11,Don't you have a mask that can summon the unseen?
487516203670204416,2014-07-11 08:38:15,Please take refuge. We are fine here. We shall greet the morning... together.
487501100119887873,2014-07-11 07:38:14,"I am Dampe, the grave keeper, who watches over this graveyard. My face is frightening, but I am not a bad person!"
487485976177291264,2014-07-11 06:38:08,You too can master it! Seek out troubled individuals and lend an ear!
487470904322961410,2014-07-11 05:38:15,You played the Oath to Order!
487455777288753154,2014-07-11 04:38:08,"Look, I'd like you to buy my bomb, too, but it's just too heavy for you to carry. Sorry."
487440758484389889,2014-07-11 03:38:27,It's true! Surely the great Darmani can do something about the blizzard that blows in from Snowhead.
487425596373229568,2014-07-11 02:38:12,"What?! Don't you know about the Skullwalltula? ... Just don't touch it, all right?"
487410508987789313,2014-07-11 01:38:15,I made a reservation... The name is Link-goro!
487395380984696832,2014-07-11 00:38:08,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
487380307373346817,2014-07-10 23:38:15,"Suddenly, memories of Princess Zelda come rushing back to you..."
487365178049044480,2014-07-10 22:38:07,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you or whatever."
487350088868446208,2014-07-10 21:38:10,You managed to figure out a code that only we know! Now that's something! I like you!
487335000136613888,2014-07-10 20:38:12,Uuuuurgh...I'm scared! I can't take it! I don't want to die!
487319919952793602,2014-07-10 19:38:17,You have just freed the innocent spirit that this dark mask had kept imprisoned within the body of evil Odolwa.
487304775294148609,2014-07-10 18:38:06,The moon has gotten so large! Quick! Take refuge as far away from town as you can!
487289697467514881,2014-07-10 17:38:11,"If you leave my mask out there, something terrible will happen!"
487274570991169537,2014-07-10 16:38:05,"Stop right there, Deku Scrub!"
487259494175363072,2014-07-10 15:38:10,"That won't do you any good. Hee, hee."
487244413999927297,2014-07-10 14:38:15,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
487229307236798464,2014-07-10 13:38:13,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
487214190914838529,2014-07-10 12:38:09,"You have strange powers, no? Me been watching you!"
487199105886584832,2014-07-10 11:38:13,"We offer our customers limited-run milk. Thus, we are a members-only establishment."
487183983172517889,2014-07-10 10:38:07,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"
487168913352847362,2014-07-10 09:38:14,See! Look at the moon... Leave town before the evacuation notice is made!
487153819751419905,2014-07-10 08:38:16,I made a reservation... The name is Link-goro!
487138717014839297,2014-07-10 07:38:15,Oh! A Goron! Do you live in the mountains? Why is Tatl with you? Why? Huh? Why?
487123587497598976,2014-07-10 06:38:08,"Oh, yeah! How was it? It went by in an instant, right? I'm still full of energy!"
487108516792905728,2014-07-10 05:38:15,Grrrr... We're the notorious Gorman Brothers! We can't get all sappy over stuff like this!
487093399292354560,2014-07-10 04:38:10,You learned the Lullaby Intro! The soothing melody of a thoughtful father.
487078299512754177,2014-07-10 03:38:10,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
487048130408357888,2014-07-10 01:38:17,Are you suggesting that my instructions will put you to sleep? How rude! Be gone!
487032997385076736,2014-07-10 00:38:09,"If people hear the great pirates have lost the treasure they stole, we'll become the laughing stock!"
487017924545114112,2014-07-09 23:38:16,Oh my? The Couple's Mask? Someone got married.
487002786941247488,2014-07-09 22:38:07,H-h-hoooo...It's cold. This cold has me hallucinating about Darmani. I can't take it.
486987715838083072,2014-07-09 21:38:13,"I must hurry! The guest arriving in the afternoon will come. Skip this, skip that!"
486972609947394048,2014-07-09 20:38:12,Uuuuurgh...I'm scared! I can't take it! I don't want to die!
486942402288959488,2014-07-09 18:38:10,"What's this? Green clothes... White fairy... Sir, could you, by chance, be a forest fairy?"
486927337049436160,2014-07-09 17:38:18,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
486912186518761472,2014-07-09 16:38:06,"Ohh, how adorable! Let me tug on your long ears. If you study the way of the sword here, you'll get your bunny dirty, so put it away."
486897104359415809,2014-07-09 15:38:10,Oh no! The Great Fairy!
486882009222877184,2014-07-09 14:38:11,"Waaah...Henh, uwaaaaah... Daaaaaddy, daaaddy...H-hunh... I'm cooold, Daaaddy!"

486836726963261440,2014-07-09 11:38:15,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you, or whatever."
486821587883003904,2014-07-09 10:38:05,No way! No Scrubs!
486806516670816256,2014-07-09 09:38:12,"Oh, sorry. That's too bad. In that case, let me hear a song written by you, baby!"
486791470037204992,2014-07-09 08:38:25,Thanks for helping last night. The cows are doing well thanks to you. And they're putting out a lot of milk!
486776323528880129,2014-07-09 07:38:14,"Stop right there, Deku Scrub!"
486761262802403328,2014-07-09 06:38:23,"Oh, the Circus Leader's Mask! He comes here a lot."
486746202801594368,2014-07-09 05:38:32,"When you wear it, you will transform into the shape you just were. When you remove it, you will return to normal."
486731033195212801,2014-07-09 04:38:16,"Is that so? Think it over, little guy!"
486715930982891520,2014-07-09 03:38:15,Ahhh... Nice weather...Isn't it?
486700853164638209,2014-07-09 02:38:20,"I must hurry! The guest arriving in the afternoon will come. Skip this, skip that!"
486685759542263808,2014-07-09 01:38:21,"If it's possible, put the scent in something and take it to the Magic Hags' Potion Shop."
486670671808700418,2014-07-09 00:38:24,"Waaah...Henh, uwaaaaah... Daaaaaddy, daaaddy...H-hunh... I'm cooold, Daaaddy!"

486640406675742721,2014-07-08 22:38:08,"No, no, daddy-o! That song doesn't sing to my heart, baby!"
486625381961584642,2014-07-08 21:38:26,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
486610299974197249,2014-07-08 20:38:30,"Oh, yeah...and, um... The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!"
486595208532877313,2014-07-08 19:38:32,"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!"
486580013488041984,2014-07-08 18:38:10,I'll just teach you the beginning...
486564986701881347,2014-07-08 17:38:27,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
486549795012505601,2014-07-08 16:38:05,This is a problem. You just can't come in and hang out in our room!
486534718238638082,2014-07-08 15:38:10,"It's a Wart. Once you've gotten rid of the spheres that shield the main body, you can attack the eye."
486519645646508033,2014-07-08 14:38:17,You got the Zora Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a legendary guitarist!
486504575231201280,2014-07-08 13:38:24,"Man, I just work here part-time, so I don't really know this stuff."
486489413577224192,2014-07-08 12:38:09,"Suddenly, memories of Princess Zelda come rushing back to you..."
486474372299759616,2014-07-08 11:38:23,"Hey, Skull Kid! Do you realize what you've been doing to everyone?!?"
486459243633987584,2014-07-08 10:38:16,Strange... Isn't it? Getting a letter from a missing person...
486444209210003457,2014-07-08 09:38:31,What's this? You've already saved up 5000 Rupees?!
486429035170258944,2014-07-08 08:38:14,"If you came here to go swimming, you should go somewhere else."
486413938507018241,2014-07-08 07:38:14,I tell you...Tingle is the very reincarnation of a fairy!
486398811284074498,2014-07-08 06:38:08,"It is dangerous outside the town walls, so I cannot allow a child like you to... A sword?"
486383784837652480,2014-07-08 05:38:25,You played the Inverted Song of Time!
486368623611490304,2014-07-08 04:38:10,Buying two of the same thing won't do you any good.
486353528428843008,2014-07-08 03:38:11,No way! No Scrubs!
486338435548844032,2014-07-08 02:38:13,The prize is Gold Dust! This stuff is the highest quality available!
486323338461995008,2014-07-08 01:38:14,You caught a Big Poe in a bottle! This may lead to something good...
486308231644332032,2014-07-08 00:38:12,"It seems the poison swamp has been cleaned up, so why not try something that's more interesting?"
486293159119298560,2014-07-07 23:38:18,"It's strange, but the way you look right now sort of looks like this tree..."
486278027735625728,2014-07-07 22:38:11,"If you play that strange song backwards, you can slow the flow of time."
486262930569035776,2014-07-07 21:38:11,Leeeaave me something small and creepy!
486247835076030465,2014-07-07 20:38:12,"No, no, daddy-o! That song doesn't sing to my heart, baby!"
486232736529526785,2014-07-07 19:38:12,You got the Fierce Deity's Mask! Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?
486217600049754113,2014-07-07 18:38:04,Your defense has been strengthened! Enemies now do half as much damage as before!
486202538102771713,2014-07-07 17:38:12,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
486187408832987138,2014-07-07 16:38:05,"It is dangerous outside the town walls, so I cannot allow a child like you to... A sword?"
486172338010865665,2014-07-07 15:38:12,I'll be on vacation for a short while. Please don't look for me.
486157237203636225,2014-07-07 14:38:12,What are you doing?!? Didn't your shield just get swallowed???
486142149595906048,2014-07-07 13:38:15,You learned the Lullaby Intro! The soothing melody of a thoughtful father.
486127020829446145,2014-07-07 12:38:08,"It's a Desbreko. Once it bites you, it's not gonna want to let go. I haaaate this thing!"
486111947289403392,2014-07-07 11:38:14,It's a mystical song that allows you to shed a shell shaped in your current image.
486096825691033600,2014-07-07 10:38:09,"Umm, Mommy... Don't go picking up bomb bags in the middle of the night anymore."
486066647623417857,2014-07-07 08:38:14,"Stop right there, Deku Scrub!"
486051572091068417,2014-07-07 07:38:19,It's a Hiploop. Quickly dodge it if it charges at you. But can't you first do something about that mask it's wearing?
486021353972056064,2014-07-07 05:38:15,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
486006232990220289,2014-07-07 04:38:10,I have a request! Kafei... I have a clue... that will help you find him.
485991157080416257,2014-07-07 03:38:15,I'll just teach you the beginning...
485976042545229825,2014-07-07 02:38:12,"We offer our customers limited-run milk. Thus, we are a members-only establishment."
485960971886657538,2014-07-07 01:38:19,I made a reservation... The name is Link-goro!
485945834362507265,2014-07-07 00:38:10,"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?"
485930756342968320,2014-07-06 23:38:15,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
485915620144209922,2014-07-06 22:38:06,I'm terribly sorry. There are no vacancies today...We're booked solid with reservations.
485900540841177088,2014-07-06 21:38:11,"With black roses etched into it, the Great Fairy's Sword is the most powerful of all blades."
485885446375755776,2014-07-06 20:38:12,"Welcome, Link... Allow me to ease your weariness."
485870349012058112,2014-07-06 19:38:12,Anju is already fleeing to Cremia's ranch.
485855229833801730,2014-07-06 18:38:08,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you or whatever."
485840147536031744,2014-07-06 17:38:12,Please take refuge. We are fine here. We shall greet the morning... together.
485825016856997889,2014-07-06 16:38:04,"Waaah...Henh, uwaaaaah... Daaaaaddy, daaaddy...H-hunh... I'm cooold, Daaaddy!"
485809938988412930,2014-07-06 15:38:10,Thank you for returning my broken and shattered body to normal.
485794843147259905,2014-07-06 14:38:10,Buying two of the same thing won't do you any good.
485779753488494592,2014-07-06 13:38:13,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
485749565488771073,2014-07-06 11:38:15,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
485734431139721216,2014-07-06 10:38:07,"If it's possible, put the scent in something and take it to the Magic Hags' Potion Shop."
485719353241767936,2014-07-06 09:38:12,Whaaat?!? You're really gonna give me that much? You're one rich little guy!
485704265013276672,2014-07-06 08:38:15,It's a mystical song that allows you to shed a shell shaped in your current image.
485689154877923328,2014-07-06 07:38:12,"What?! Don't you know about the Skullwalltula? ... Just don't touch it, all right?"
485674067815448576,2014-07-06 06:38:15,"Hey, you're kinda cool."
485659003444146177,2014-07-06 05:38:24,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
485643863898353664,2014-07-06 04:38:14,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
485628783655788544,2014-07-06 03:38:19,"It's a Gibdo. You won't be able to move if it glares at you, so be careful!"
485613696568160257,2014-07-06 02:38:22,You too can master it! Seek out troubled individuals and lend an ear!
485598592925581313,2014-07-06 01:38:21,"Is that so? Think it over, little guy!"
485568379038621696,2014-07-05 23:38:17,"We have all been expecting your next order, sir."
485553277061173248,2014-07-05 22:38:17,Young one! Please hear my plea! I have been broken and shattered to pieces by the masked Skull Kid.
485538170176405504,2014-07-05 21:38:15,"(Translation) I am disappointed, oh moon. I have died!"
485523081725616128,2014-07-05 20:38:17,Ahhh... Nice weather...Isn't it?
485507946931945472,2014-07-05 19:38:09,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
485492828995215360,2014-07-05 18:38:05,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."
485477757225152513,2014-07-05 17:38:11,"Look, I'd like you to buy my bomb, too, but it's just too heavy for you to carry. Sorry."
485462624906133504,2014-07-05 16:38:03,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"
485447553823948802,2014-07-05 15:38:10,Oh! Darmani! I've been waiting impatiently for you.
485432453335506944,2014-07-05 14:38:10,"Oh, it was the fairy's light. In that case, it's just perfect."
485417363697704961,2014-07-05 13:38:12,Er... W-W-Whewwwould you like me to read you a story?
485402243747692545,2014-07-05 12:38:07,"No, no, daddy-o! That song doesn't sing to my heart, baby!"
485387162989260801,2014-07-05 11:38:12,"Is that so? Think it over, little guy!"
485372039713157120,2014-07-05 10:38:06,You bought back the Gilded Sword that was stolen from you!
485356969637597184,2014-07-05 09:38:13,"Oh, kind young one! Please find the fairies trapped in Great Bay Temple."
485341879576182784,2014-07-05 08:38:15,"And just between you and me, the Skull Kid is no match for the Great Fairy."
485326782120202240,2014-07-05 07:38:16,"Ohh, how adorable! Let me tug on your long ears. If you study the way of the sword here, you'll get your bunny dirty, so put it away."
485311646257004544,2014-07-05 06:38:07,"Though you may not understand these grown-up matters, you should probably take the pendant to Anju, anyway."
485296567415361538,2014-07-05 05:38:12,But Deku Scrubs are supposed to like rain. At least one of us has reason to be happy...
485266375816925185,2014-07-05 03:38:14,We were about to punish an innocent monkey!
485251272690253826,2014-07-05 02:38:13,Oh! Darmani! I've been waiting impatiently for you.
485236187133534208,2014-07-05 01:38:16,"If you came here to go swimming, you should go somewhere else."
485221064717246464,2014-07-05 00:38:11,Er... W-W-Whewwwould you like me to read you a story?
485205977788997633,2014-07-04 23:38:14,"If you play that strange song backwards, you can slow the flow of time."
485190840701046785,2014-07-04 22:38:05,"If you're gonna fall, then what's stoppin' ya, you monster?!"
485175777445412864,2014-07-04 21:38:14,The moon has gotten so large! Quick! Take refuge as far away from town as you can!
485160673375043585,2014-07-04 20:38:13,Well...could you see it? It already may be impossible to stop its descent...
485145558839881728,2014-07-04 19:38:09,"Huh? Do you mean you haven't been approved to carry Powder Kegs, yet?"
485130442681511936,2014-07-04 18:38:05,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
485115368998834177,2014-07-04 17:38:11,Those sideburns...Aren't you Darmani? You're supposed to be dead...but you're alive? What have you been doing?
485100249556348929,2014-07-04 16:38:06,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
485085168403623937,2014-07-04 15:38:11,You did it! You helped Cremia! You feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Sigh... You could get used to this!
485070066254217216,2014-07-04 14:38:10,I'm sorry. We're totally booked with reservations. Please tell that to your mother.
485054975777591298,2014-07-04 13:38:12,"If you leave my mask out there, something terrible will happen!"
485009674027012100,2014-07-04 10:38:11,"Ahh, I wanna find a girlfriend and get married soon, too..."

484964380623122432,2014-07-04 07:38:13,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
484949276963790848,2014-07-04 06:38:12,"Hey, you're kinda cool."
484934196368904192,2014-07-04 05:38:16,You caught a Big Poe in a bottle! This may lead to something good...
484904047585943553,2014-07-04 03:38:28,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."

484873854716608512,2014-07-04 01:38:30,"If you're going to Great Bay, your timing is great. You should leave here as quickly as you can!"
484858699278606336,2014-07-04 00:38:16,Please take refuge. We are fine here. We shall greet the morning... together.
484843623591051264,2014-07-03 23:38:22,Only Jim and us are supposed to know about that secret route...
484828476172562432,2014-07-03 22:38:11,"That's a Gekko. And it's pretty angry! It's pretty weak, too. It really shouldn't be making a fool of you."
484813418667319296,2014-07-03 21:38:21,"What's this? Green clothes... White fairy... Sir, could you, by chance, be a forest fairy?"
484798302349574144,2014-07-03 20:38:17,Oh no! The Great Fairy!
484783196765057024,2014-07-03 19:38:15,"And just between you and me, the Skull Kid is no match for the Great Fairy."
484768056351019010,2014-07-03 18:38:05,"I am Dampe, the grave keeper, who watches over this graveyard. My face is frightening, but I am not a bad person!"
484752974992793600,2014-07-03 17:38:10,I'll never forget the days we spent together in Hyrule...
484737856582062080,2014-07-03 16:38:05,"Hee, hee! Now, that's a good look for you! You'll stay here looking that way forever!"
484722770572357633,2014-07-03 15:38:08,"Pa-Pa-Pa-Paper, please!"
484707677235212288,2014-07-03 14:38:10,You have just freed the innocent spirit that this dark mask had kept imprisoned within the body of evil Odolwa.
484692583319224320,2014-07-03 13:38:11,I entered to win some concert tickets... Don't ya have anything to deliver to me?
484677476279275520,2014-07-03 12:38:09,You got a Bomb Bag! Now you can carry and use bombs!
484662415762534400,2014-07-03 11:38:19,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
484647294864588801,2014-07-03 10:38:14,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
484632223497613312,2014-07-03 09:38:20,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
484617100367908864,2014-07-03 08:38:15,What are you doing?!? Didn't your shield just get swallowed???
484602015985577984,2014-07-03 07:38:18,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.
484586887986704385,2014-07-03 06:38:11,"From now on, be more aware of birds when you're strolling down the road..."
484571806980775937,2014-07-03 05:38:16,"With black roses etched into it, the Great Fairy's Sword is the most powerful of all blades."
484556680512815105,2014-07-03 04:38:10,Oh! Darmani! I've been waiting impatiently for you.
484541615210364928,2014-07-03 03:38:18,I hate it! I hate it! I wanna see it! I wanna see it! I wanna see the race!
484526507251884032,2014-07-03 02:38:16,But outside it seems to have gotten kind of...dangerous. Yikes... I'm gettin' outta town!
484496291666219008,2014-07-03 00:38:12,Sorry! Pretend you didn't hear that. My sister will get mad at me.
484481202481405954,2014-07-02 23:38:14,W-What just happened?! Everything has... started over...
484466071689113602,2014-07-02 22:38:07,"I must hurry! The guest arriving in the afternoon will come. Skip this, skip that!"
484451001122832385,2014-07-02 21:38:13,"What?! Don't you know about the Skullwalltula? ... Just don't touch it, all right?"
484435908104429568,2014-07-02 20:38:15,Oh my? The Couple's Mask? Someone got married.
484420797415444480,2014-07-02 19:38:12,I...I shall consume. Consume...Consume everything.
484405672126062592,2014-07-02 18:38:06,That ill-mannered troublemaker from the other day said he'd break my instruments...
484390593787731968,2014-07-02 17:38:11,"Oh, it was the fairy's light. In that case, it's just perfect."
484375475012116481,2014-07-02 16:38:07,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.
484360394194944000,2014-07-02 15:38:11,"Oh, sorry. That's too bad. In that case, let me hear a song written by you, baby!"
484330222968262658,2014-07-02 13:38:18,All right! That Skull Kid broke our rules and he's been doing all kinds of bad things lately.
484300024684093441,2014-07-02 11:38:18,Please enjoy the Carnival of Time.
484284875919208450,2014-07-02 10:38:06,"This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy Racetrack, just like the sign says."
484269839947558913,2014-07-02 09:38:21,"You got a Room Key! ??? You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation..."
484254728012840961,2014-07-02 08:38:18,Sorry! Pretend you didn't hear that. My sister will get mad at me.
484239614756933632,2014-07-02 07:38:15,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
484224478776270848,2014-07-02 06:38:06,Oh! Darmani! I've been waiting impatiently for you.
484209413519970305,2014-07-02 05:38:15,What's that?!? The Skull Kid got to Koume?!?
484194300280860673,2014-07-02 04:38:11,Don't you have a mask that can summon the unseen?
484179240535851008,2014-07-02 03:38:21,You did it! You helped Cremia! You feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Sigh... You could get used to this!
484164159651975169,2014-07-02 02:38:25,"Say, what are the townsfolk saying about that moon? It's bigger than before, isn't it?"
484149022630760448,2014-07-02 01:38:16,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
484133884649422848,2014-07-02 00:38:07,I don't need that weird mask!
484103688286265344,2014-07-01 22:38:08,"That's a Real Bombchu! It runs at you with its pack of explosives, so protect yourself or else!"
484088619225718784,2014-07-01 21:38:15,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
484073522315014144,2014-07-01 20:38:16,What's with that Deku Scrub? It's just sleeping here like a lazy fool! What a pain!
484058408354471936,2014-07-01 19:38:12,No using masks in the store because of past indiscretions!
484043303407468544,2014-07-01 18:38:11,Grrrr... We're the notorious Gorman Brothers! We can't get all sappy over stuff like this!
484028211907399680,2014-07-01 17:38:13,"Oh, yeah...and, um... The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!"
483998073119465472,2014-07-01 15:38:27,"OK, it's closing time. Quick! Get outta here!"
483982919027793920,2014-07-01 14:38:14,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
483967826449809408,2014-07-01 13:38:16,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"
483952697138110464,2014-07-01 12:38:09,I'm terribly sorry. There are no vacancies today...We're booked solid with reservations.
483922502662361088,2014-07-01 10:38:10,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
483907452811767808,2014-07-01 09:38:21,"When you wear it, you will transform into the shape you just were. When you remove it, you will return to normal."
483892401480540161,2014-07-01 08:38:33,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
483878694599921665,2014-07-01 07:44:05,But outside it seems to have gotten kind of...dangerous. Yikes... I'm gettin' outta town!
483862347941830658,2014-07-01 06:39:08,"It's a Wart. Once you've gotten rid of the spheres that shield the main body, you can attack the eye."
483847767828086785,2014-07-01 05:41:11,"Huh? Do you mean you haven't been approved to carry Powder Kegs, yet?"
483835194361667586,2014-07-01 04:51:14,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.
483818137423323136,2014-07-01 03:43:27,I have a request! Kafei... I have a clue... that will help you find him.
483801821014548480,2014-07-01 02:38:37,Bremor! Don't be standin' 'round lookin' at yer feet all day!
483786716864446464,2014-07-01 01:38:36,"And just between you and me, the Skull Kid is no match for the Great Fairy."
483771558041645056,2014-07-01 00:38:22,You cannot proceed any further through time...

483726261827551232,2014-06-30 21:38:22,Return the flow of time to normal?
483711181245267969,2014-06-30 20:38:27,The prize is Gold Dust! This stuff is the highest quality available!
483696065133019136,2014-06-30 19:38:23,"What?! Don't you know about the Skullwalltula? ... Just don't touch it, all right?"
483680918737924097,2014-06-30 18:38:12,"Oh, why do we have to play these stupid brats' little games? C'mon! Hurry up and find them already!"
483665863413739520,2014-06-30 17:38:22,Ye who hold my remains... Return to the appointed place to face me...
483620588544475136,2014-06-30 14:38:28,"I must hurry! The guest arriving in the afternoon will come. Skip this, skip that!"
483605471127818240,2014-06-30 13:38:23,No way! No Scrubs!
483590383964672001,2014-06-30 12:38:26,"This isn't ""members-only,"" so take that thing off. I kid you not!"
483575263184175104,2014-06-30 11:38:21,"That's a Real Bombchu! It runs at you with its pack of explosives, so protect yourself or else!"
483560157117288450,2014-06-30 10:38:20,You traded for the Largest Quiver! Now you can now hold up to 50 arrows!
483545094578900994,2014-06-30 09:38:29,Don't you have a mask that can summon the unseen?
483529981272666113,2014-06-30 08:38:25,I'll be on vacation for a short while. Please don't look for me.
483499745009090560,2014-06-30 06:38:16,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
483484695888289792,2014-06-30 05:38:28,Bremor! Don't be standin' 'round lookin' at yer feet all day!
483470412395732993,2014-06-30 04:41:43,H-h-hoooo...It's cold. This cold has me hallucinating about Darmani. I can't take it.
483459238950232065,2014-06-30 03:57:19,"If you don't have a bow, you can't play."
483439619413770240,2014-06-30 02:39:21,It's true! Surely the great Darmani can do something about the blizzard that blows in from Snowhead.
483424320639606784,2014-06-30 01:38:34,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."

483394094048100354,2014-06-29 23:38:27,"OK, it's closing time. Quick! Get outta here!"
483378940686249984,2014-06-29 22:38:14,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
483363891217326080,2014-06-29 21:38:26,W-What just happened?! Everything has... started over...
483348755844853760,2014-06-29 20:38:18,You cannot proceed any further through time...
483333633474695168,2014-06-29 19:38:12,"You got the Bremen Mask! This mask belonged to the leader  of the animal troupe. Try parading it around tiny, young animals."
483318516745895936,2014-06-29 18:38:08,You shall remember this song!
483303438504054786,2014-06-29 17:38:13,"But something has to be done about this cold. Otherwise, we'll be Goronsicles."
483288312791052288,2014-06-29 16:38:07,See! Look at the moon... Leave town before the evacuation notice is made!
483273285266702336,2014-06-29 15:38:24,Oh! A Goron! Do you live in the mountains? Why is Tatl with you? Why? Huh? Why?
483258142147362818,2014-06-29 14:38:14,Shut up. I'm busy right now...
483243050886393856,2014-06-29 13:38:16,Anju is already fleeing to Cremia's ranch.
483227926653964288,2014-06-29 12:38:10,Please take refuge. We are fine here. We shall greet the morning... together.
483212887020687361,2014-06-29 11:38:24,"Oh, the Circus Leader's Mask! He comes here a lot."
483197740801740800,2014-06-29 10:38:13,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
483182824623599617,2014-06-29 09:38:57,And they say the world is a hard place. Look at you! I'd say you're pretty lucky!
483167563061293056,2014-06-29 08:38:18,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
483152460920270848,2014-06-29 07:38:17,It looks like the lady is taking a break. Let's not bother her.
483137328433475584,2014-06-29 06:38:10,"From now on, be more aware of birds when you're strolling down the road..."

483092072732192768,2014-06-29 03:38:20,You have just freed the innocent spirit that this dark mask had kept imprisoned within the body of evil Odolwa.
483076955407798272,2014-06-29 02:38:15,I don't need that weird mask!
483061877396631553,2014-06-29 01:38:21,Open your ears and listen hard!

483031666324029440,2014-06-28 23:38:18,Are you suggesting that my instructions will put you to sleep? How rude! Be gone!
483016527604490241,2014-06-28 22:38:08,"If you leave my mask out there, something terrible will happen!"
483001445839413248,2014-06-28 21:38:13,You found all the Stray Fairies! Quick! Take them to their fellow fairies of the same color!
482986371758301186,2014-06-28 20:38:19,Careful! Don't go blowing yourself up in a place like this... I kid you not!
482971254765273088,2014-06-28 19:38:14,"My son often used that mask to find mushrooms in the forest. Oh, how I long for those days."
482956123197030400,2014-06-28 18:38:07,You traded for the Largest Quiver! Now you can now hold up to 50 arrows!

482895745586962434,2014-06-28 14:38:12,"If you could somehow step on top of that Octorok, I bet you'd be able to climb onto that central pillar."
482880653810073600,2014-06-28 13:38:14,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
482865535936262144,2014-06-28 12:38:09,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"

482820268977434624,2014-06-28 09:38:17,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
482805168128266241,2014-06-28 08:38:16,You cannot proceed any further through time...

482759885348536320,2014-06-28 05:38:20,Buying two of the same thing won't do you any good.
482744744900968450,2014-06-28 04:38:10,You got the Goron Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a proud Goron hero!

482533375027064832,2014-06-27 14:38:16,"Oh, man! I didn't think you'd come over here."
482518279227863040,2014-06-27 13:38:17,The mask that was stolen from me... It is called Majora's Mask.
482503146657173506,2014-06-27 12:38:09,"Returning to Snowhead, are you? It's dangerous at night, so be especially careful."
482488072257277953,2014-06-27 11:38:15,You got a Magic Jar! Your magic power is replenished!
482472950776340482,2014-06-27 10:38:10,That ill-mannered troublemaker from the other day said he'd break my instruments...
482457896165208065,2014-06-27 09:38:20,No using masks in the store because of past indiscretions!

482035099198697472,2014-06-26 05:38:18,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."

480902618290454528,2014-06-23 02:38:13,You got the Zora Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a legendary guitarist!
480887585267408896,2014-06-23 01:38:29,"Do you already have bombs, the special product of the Gorons?"
480872425836384256,2014-06-23 00:38:15,"We have all been expecting your next order, sir."
480857346915045377,2014-06-22 23:38:20,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
480842200083726336,2014-06-22 22:38:08,Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone and attracted some weirdo's attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.
480827135192363008,2014-06-22 21:38:17,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
480812029305839616,2014-06-22 20:38:15,"Umm, Mommy... Don't go picking up bomb bags in the middle of the night anymore."
480781794820640768,2014-06-22 18:38:07,I won't do it! You go by yourself! I'm staying here with Tael.
480766730688409603,2014-06-22 17:38:15,"From now on, be more aware of birds when you're strolling down the road..."
480751596691668993,2014-06-22 16:38:07,Shut up. I'm busy right now...
480736518286233600,2014-06-22 15:38:12,"Are you, by chance, a boat cruise customer?"
480721427679567872,2014-06-22 14:38:14,Only Sakon can open it. The only way in is to wait for Sakon to arrive.
480706332580794370,2014-06-22 13:38:15,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
480676151963025408,2014-06-22 11:38:19,"But something has to be done about this cold. Otherwise, we'll be Goronsicles."
480661018985525248,2014-06-22 10:38:11,"(Translation) I am disappointed, oh moon. I have died!"
480645946749878273,2014-06-22 09:38:18,What are you doing?!? Didn't your shield just get swallowed???
480630852078940160,2014-06-22 08:38:19,"If you're going to Great Bay, your timing is great. You should leave here as quickly as you can!"
480615737212428288,2014-06-22 07:38:15,You learned the Lullaby Intro! The soothing melody of a thoughtful father.
480600614498361344,2014-06-22 06:38:10,You got the Boss Key! Now you can enter the chamber where the boss lurks!
480585545790148608,2014-06-22 05:38:17,The prize is Gold Dust! This stuff is the highest quality available!
480570458568273920,2014-06-22 04:38:20,Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone and attracted some weirdo's attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.
480555345224294400,2014-06-22 03:38:17,"If you leave my mask out there, something terrible will happen!"
480540258728038400,2014-06-22 02:38:20,"Hey, you're kinda cool."
480525169027338240,2014-06-22 01:38:22,Thanks for helping last night. The cows are doing well thanks to you. And they're putting out a lot of milk!
480510026952351746,2014-06-22 00:38:12,Buying two of the same thing won't do you any good.
480494973851160576,2014-06-21 23:38:23,"But something has to be done about this cold. Otherwise, we'll be Goronsicles."
480479832518578176,2014-06-21 22:38:13,"Suddenly, memories of Princess Zelda come rushing back to you..."
480464752829661184,2014-06-21 21:38:18,Whaaat?!? You're really gonna give me that much? You're one rich little guy!
480449647677173760,2014-06-21 20:38:16,Hey...you don't have a bow. I can't sell you these! I kid you not!
480434538380673025,2014-06-21 19:38:14,That's Romani's Mask. Only adult customers can get that mask.
480419418799738880,2014-06-21 18:38:09,You learned the Lullaby Intro! The soothing melody of a thoughtful father.
480404324665675776,2014-06-21 17:38:11,Be careful... I sense a lot of evil here.
480389200710103041,2014-06-21 16:38:05,H-h-hoooo...It's cold. This cold has me hallucinating about Darmani. I can't take it.
480374145390108672,2014-06-21 15:38:15,Your notes echoed far... but nothing happened.
480343954999631872,2014-06-21 13:38:17,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
480328826736492544,2014-06-21 12:38:11,"Upon impact, it makes a blinding flash, freezing enemies in their tracks!"
480313747433484289,2014-06-21 11:38:15,"It's a Gibdo. You won't be able to move if it glares at you, so be careful!"
480298642570358784,2014-06-21 10:38:14,You got the Goron Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a proud Goron hero!
480283531516473345,2014-06-21 09:38:11,You managed to figure out a code that only we know! Now that's something! I like you!
480268455526928384,2014-06-21 08:38:17,"It's Jo, second of the four ghost sisters. Aim when she appears. Hurry! There's no time!"
480253344628236288,2014-06-21 07:38:14,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
480238219233996800,2014-06-21 06:38:08,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
480223151561781248,2014-06-21 05:38:16,You got a Bomb Bag! Now you can carry and use bombs!
480208024305283075,2014-06-21 04:38:09,You bought back the Gilded Sword that was stolen from you!
480192974244962305,2014-06-21 03:38:21,Hey...you don't have a bow. I can't sell you these! I kid you not!
480177935400198144,2014-06-21 02:38:35,You caught a Big Poe in a bottle! This may lead to something good...
480162786211659776,2014-06-21 01:38:23,It's true! Surely the great Darmani can do something about the blizzard that blows in from Snowhead.
480147642496712704,2014-06-21 00:38:13,"Say, what are the townsfolk saying about that moon? It's bigger than before, isn't it?"
480132575583674368,2014-06-20 23:38:21,What's this? You've already saved up 5000 Rupees?!
480117425782796288,2014-06-20 22:38:09,"My sister Romani has been worried, too. She's practicing using a bow... She says it's to stop the ""ghosts."""
480102472120164354,2014-06-20 21:38:43,But outside it seems to have gotten kind of...dangerous. Yikes... I'm gettin' outta town!
480087273749241856,2014-06-20 20:38:20,"So, please, give me that which you promised me... Don't tell me... My mask... You did... get it back...Didn't you?"
480072218374729728,2014-06-20 19:38:30,"If you came here to go swimming, you should go somewhere else."
480057034239266817,2014-06-20 18:38:10,The mask that was stolen from me... It is called Majora's Mask.
480041976796942337,2014-06-20 17:38:20,"100 steps north, 100 steps south, 100 steps east, 100 steps west. The spot at which those giants parted is right in the middle of this town."
480011783176847360,2014-06-20 15:38:21,The prize is Gold Dust! This stuff is the highest quality available!
479996737088544768,2014-06-20 14:38:34,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.
479981573635186689,2014-06-20 13:38:19,You traded for the Largest Quiver! Now you can now hold up to 50 arrows!
479966456646356994,2014-06-20 12:38:15,Sorry! Pretend you didn't hear that. My sister will get mad at me.
479951372935131136,2014-06-20 11:38:19,Be careful... I sense a lot of evil here.
479936257896615937,2014-06-20 10:38:15,"Oh, yeah...and, um... The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!"
479921170397941761,2014-06-20 09:38:18,"This is the room of Evan, the leader of the Zora Band, The Indigo-Go's."
479906081263464449,2014-06-20 08:38:20,Those inssside... Our friendsss... Brrrriiiiinnnng them!
479890986001125376,2014-06-20 07:38:21,"I hear some ghosts or something appeared at Romani Ranch yesterday, and now all their cows are gone."
479875846316900352,2014-06-20 06:38:12,I'll just teach you the beginning...
479860787570171904,2014-06-20 05:38:21,"This does the trick when you need energy, but you need an empty bottle to keep it in..."
479845668182163456,2014-06-20 04:38:17,The canyon at Stone Tower lies this way. Be careful.
479830581518168065,2014-06-20 03:38:20,"Hey, guy! You haven't passed my test, so how do you know my secret code?"
479815655835697152,2014-06-20 02:39:01,"My son often used that mask to find mushrooms in the forest. Oh, how I long for those days."
479800401802178561,2014-06-20 01:38:24,The mask that was stolen from me... It is called Majora's Mask.
479785256036229120,2014-06-20 00:38:13,"It's strange, but the way you look right now sort of looks like this tree..."
479770202721120257,2014-06-19 23:38:24,"You got Kamaro's Mask! Use it to teach his dance to the world, so his moves can become as popular as he had hoped they would be."
479755057462665218,2014-06-19 22:38:13,"Returning to Snowhead, are you? It's dangerous at night, so be especially careful."
479740014859808769,2014-06-19 21:38:27,"It's a Wart. Once you've gotten rid of the spheres that shield the main body, you can attack the eye."
479724917693235201,2014-06-19 20:38:27,Whaaat?!? You're really gonna give me that much? You're one rich little guy!
479709991595569152,2014-06-19 19:39:09,You got the Boss Key! Now you can enter the chamber where the boss lurks!
479694647539687424,2014-06-19 18:38:10,"I'm sure it was because he was always playing tricks, so nobody wanted to play with him."
479679552021463040,2014-06-19 17:38:11,"It's Jo, second of the four ghost sisters. Aim when she appears. Hurry! There's no time!"
479664432960638976,2014-06-19 16:38:07,Ye who hold my remains... Return to the appointed place to face me...
479649355171786752,2014-06-19 15:38:12,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
479634255899684864,2014-06-19 14:38:12,Have you been to the Clock Tower plaza yet?
479619161232912384,2014-06-19 13:38:13,"Say, what are the townsfolk saying about that moon? It's bigger than before, isn't it?"
479604041500991488,2014-06-19 12:38:08,"That's a Gekko. And it's pretty angry! It's pretty weak, too. It really shouldn't be making a fool of you."
479588964282560512,2014-06-19 11:38:14,It looks like the lady is taking a break. Let's not bother her.
479573838716362752,2014-06-19 10:38:07,Thank you for returning my broken and shattered body to normal.
479558770469515264,2014-06-19 09:38:15,It's a mystical song that allows you to shed a shell shaped in your current image.
479543662980784129,2014-06-19 08:38:13,"Though you may not understand these grown-up matters, you should probably take the pendant to Anju, anyway."
479528565570945024,2014-06-19 07:38:13,"You got the Bunny Hood! My, what long ears it has! Will the power of the wild spring forth?"
479513461794168832,2014-06-19 06:38:12,Anju is already fleeing to Cremia's ranch.
479498376791072768,2014-06-19 05:38:16,You learned the Lullaby Intro! The soothing melody of a thoughtful father.
479483251774328832,2014-06-19 04:38:10,Leeeaave me something small and creepy!
479468177231855616,2014-06-19 03:38:16,What's that?!? The Skull Kid got to Koume?!?
479453076504330240,2014-06-19 02:38:15,Open your ears and listen hard!
479437996953849856,2014-06-19 01:38:20,"Heyyy! You don't have that much! You shouldn't lie to people! And you can take that to the bank, mister!"
479422844829323265,2014-06-19 00:38:08,You played the Oath to Order!
479407776112734208,2014-06-18 23:38:15,Bremor! Don't be standin' 'round lookin' at yer feet all day!
479392656066244609,2014-06-18 22:38:10,"That's my life savings. If I can buy safety with it, then it's worth it."
479377594773549059,2014-06-18 21:38:19,You have just freed the innocent spirit that this dark mask had kept imprisoned within the body of evil Odolwa.
479362492494131200,2014-06-18 20:38:18,"Hee-hee-ho! Hello, child. If you are attempting to fool me, it is impossible."
479347366286209024,2014-06-18 19:38:12,This is a problem. You just can't come in and hang out in our room!
479332262261977089,2014-06-18 18:38:11,And they say the world is a hard place. Look at you! I'd say you're pretty lucky!
479317171927932931,2014-06-18 17:38:13,I can tell you're not very used to your Deku Scrub body yet.
479302048563748864,2014-06-18 16:38:08,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
479286967897583616,2014-06-18 15:38:12,I'm shocked. You're the first person who's ever spoken to me.
479271866532524032,2014-06-18 14:38:12,You got the Goron Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a proud Goron hero!
479256788563283969,2014-06-18 13:38:17,"It is dangerous outside the town walls, so I cannot allow a child like you to... A sword?"
479226590942220288,2014-06-18 11:38:17,"Ye who hold the sacred sword, leave proof of our encounter."
479211464075403264,2014-06-18 10:38:11,"Hey! Hey, Mikau! Don't hang around here. Hurry up and start the rehearsal!"
479196393836265472,2014-06-18 09:38:17,"Certainly, he had far too many weaknesses to use my power."
479181290684420096,2014-06-18 08:38:17,You got a Bomb Bag! Now you can carry and use bombs!
479166192481882113,2014-06-18 07:38:17,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
479151058267017216,2014-06-18 06:38:09,"My name's Tatl. So, uh, it's nice to meet you or whatever."
479135991953756161,2014-06-18 05:38:17,You bought back the Gilded Sword that was stolen from you!
479120874780364800,2014-06-18 04:38:12,"That melody's bogus, man!"
479105791375339520,2014-06-18 03:38:16,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
479090695903268864,2014-06-18 02:38:17,"Somebody! Anybody!!! Goddess of Time, help us please! We need more time!"
479075606210961409,2014-06-18 01:38:19,Why do you wear a ninja's mask? Do you wish to become a ninja in the future?
479060481777213444,2014-06-18 00:38:14,"They fall from what looks to be the moon's eye, so I call them Moon's Tears."
479045411433242624,2014-06-17 23:38:20,Well...could you see it? It already may be impossible to stop its descent...
479030254346829824,2014-06-17 22:38:07,Whoa-ho-ho! Niiiice sideburns!
479015191049293828,2014-06-17 21:38:15,"If you're going to Great Bay, your timing is great. You should leave here as quickly as you can!"
478984991779467264,2014-06-17 19:38:15,"Hey, Skull Kid, what if you gave that mask you're wearing back now?"
478969936807620608,2014-06-17 18:38:26,Ye who hold my remains... Return to the appointed place to face me...
478954786524377088,2014-06-17 17:38:14,"Oh, why do we have to play these stupid brats' little games? C'mon! Hurry up and find them already!"
478939666452738049,2014-06-17 16:38:09,Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon. Hurry... The four who are there... Bring them here...
478924575455969281,2014-06-17 15:38:11,Buying two of the same thing won't do you any good.
478909484119511040,2014-06-17 14:38:13,That ill-mannered troublemaker from the other day said he'd break my instruments...
478894388727123970,2014-06-17 13:38:14,Ahhh... Nice weather...Isn't it?
478879274091302912,2014-06-17 12:38:10,Be careful... I sense a lot of evil here.
478864217395576833,2014-06-17 11:38:20,I entered to win some concert tickets... Don't ya have anything to deliver to me?
478849124343615488,2014-06-17 10:38:22,Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone and attracted some weirdo's attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.
478834036928827393,2014-06-17 09:38:25,"I hear some ghosts or something appeared at Romani Ranch yesterday, and now all their cows are gone."
478818914059563008,2014-06-17 08:38:19,You managed to figure out a code that only we know! Now that's something! I like you!
478803793585254400,2014-06-17 07:38:14,"Upon impact, it makes a blinding flash, freezing enemies in their tracks!"
478788681382109185,2014-06-17 06:38:11,Whoa-ho-ho! Niiiice sideburns!
478773619326066689,2014-06-17 05:38:20,Eh-hee-hee...You have the same smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods...
478758487464214528,2014-06-17 04:38:12,"As a special just for you, I'll let you take this cruise for free."
478743408559656960,2014-06-17 03:38:17,"My son often used that mask to find mushrooms in the forest. Oh, how I long for those days."
478728360357404672,2014-06-17 02:38:30,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
478713226230644736,2014-06-17 01:38:21,You found all the Stray Fairies! Quick! Take them to their fellow fairies of the same color!
478698106993647616,2014-06-17 00:38:17,Oh my? The Couple's Mask? Someone got married.
478683055364657152,2014-06-16 23:38:28,Your defense has been strengthened! Enemies now do half as much damage as before!
478667868712628224,2014-06-16 22:38:07,W-What just happened?! Everything has... started over...
478637701680201728,2014-06-16 20:38:15,"They fall from what looks to be the moon's eye, so I call them Moon's Tears."
478622594715750400,2014-06-16 19:38:13,"100 steps north, 100 steps south, 100 steps east, 100 steps west. The spot at which those giants parted is right in the middle of this town."
478607475134824449,2014-06-16 18:38:08,That ill-mannered troublemaker from the other day said he'd break my instruments...
478592391541059584,2014-06-16 17:38:12,That is a nice mask. It is a sentimental item that exudes a lot of maturity.
478577269623889920,2014-06-16 16:38:07,It's an Eyegore. Simply attacking it is no good. I say you should pay attention to the subtle changes in its eye.
478562203537133568,2014-06-16 15:38:15,"Accepting this keepsake doesn't make much sense to you, but you should take it anyway."
478547082983141377,2014-06-16 14:38:10,"Why was the...? Why was the...? Why was the dog the leader?!? Was it 'cause something was wrong with me, sir???"
478532003201945601,2014-06-16 13:38:14,"Huh? Do you mean you haven't been approved to carry Powder Kegs, yet?"
478516887026823169,2014-06-16 12:38:10,Play after me.
478501793295368192,2014-06-16 11:38:12,The ghosts of a hundred soldiers swear allegiance to this symbol of authority.
478486677967499264,2014-06-16 10:38:08,I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?
478471615391346689,2014-06-16 09:38:17,"Friends are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh."
478456507235708929,2014-06-16 08:38:15,But outside it seems to have gotten kind of...dangerous. Yikes... I'm gettin' outta town!
478441411675553793,2014-06-16 07:38:16,"Ah! That stone! You must hand it over to me! In exchange, I'll give you my spot here... Deku Flower included!"
478426285505380353,2014-06-16 06:38:09,"The pirates in this fortress are all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous."
478411215488577536,2014-06-16 05:38:16,"I'm sure it was because he was always playing tricks, so nobody wanted to play with him."
478396093370073088,2014-06-16 04:38:11,"You'll be fine. Surely, you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."
478381023885934592,2014-06-16 03:38:18,Will you stop staring and just open that door for me?!?
478365976090517504,2014-06-16 02:38:30,"If you're going to Great Bay, your timing is great. You should leave here as quickly as you can!"
478350823022272512,2014-06-16 01:38:18,You did it! You helped Cremia! You feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Sigh... You could get used to this!
478335697296707584,2014-06-16 00:38:11,"So, please, give me that which you promised me... Don't tell me... My mask... You did... get it back...Didn't you?"
478320686432141312,2014-06-15 23:38:33,Ruff! ...I'm here for my wife and child. There's no way I'll lose!
478305490028331008,2014-06-15 22:38:09,Oh my? The Couple's Mask? Someone got married.
478290408485560320,2014-06-15 21:38:14,"Oh, yeah...and, um... The Bombers Secret Society of Justice forever!"
478275313172889600,2014-06-15 20:38:15,"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?"
478260195873677312,2014-06-15 19:38:11,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"
478245080789442560,2014-06-15 18:38:07,"Man, I just work here part-time, so I don't really know this stuff."
478230003935481856,2014-06-15 17:38:12,"You got the Bremen Mask! This mask belonged to the leader  of the animal troupe. Try parading it around tiny, young animals."
478214879094910977,2014-06-15 16:38:06,Look closely! The bugs seem to gather around fire!
478199789952053248,2014-06-15 15:38:09,You got the Goron Mask! This mask contains the spirit of a proud Goron hero!
478184704751845376,2014-06-15 14:38:12,Strange... Isn't it? Getting a letter from a missing person...
478169613797036032,2014-06-15 13:38:14,"That's a Gekko. And it's pretty angry! It's pretty weak, too. It really shouldn't be making a fool of you."
478154496338432000,2014-06-15 12:38:10,"Ye who hold the sacred sword, leave proof of our encounter."
478139415181545472,2014-06-15 11:38:14,"I must hurry! The guest arriving in the afternoon will come. Skip this, skip that!"
478109217178398721,2014-06-15 09:38:14,I can tell you're not very used to your Deku Scrub body yet.
478094122838814720,2014-06-15 08:38:16,Did some middle-aged woman put you to work?
478079060971487233,2014-06-15 07:38:25,Those inssside... Our friendsss... Brrrriiiiinnnng them!

477928028954054657,2014-06-14 21:38:16,"This melody, lingering on the edges of your mind, is a song of memories of Princess Zelda."
477912945007939584,2014-06-14 20:38:19,Leeeaave me something small and creepy!

477882713941098496,2014-06-14 18:38:12,"Hey, Skull Kid! Do you realize what you've been doing to everyone?!?"
477867612500549632,2014-06-14 17:38:11,"If it's possible, put the scent in something and take it to the Magic Hags' Potion Shop."
477852492969963520,2014-06-14 16:38:07,"Oh, kind young one! Please find the fairies trapped in Great Bay Temple."
477837411305529344,2014-06-14 15:38:11,You cannot proceed any further through time...
477822315154006016,2014-06-14 14:38:12,You can look in the postboxes... I wish I could!
477792101774544897,2014-06-14 12:38:08,"We offer our customers limited-run milk. Thus, we are a members-only establishment."
477777026066038785,2014-06-14 11:38:14,"My sister Romani has been worried, too. She's practicing using a bow... She says it's to stop the ""ghosts."""
477761904681549824,2014-06-14 10:38:09,See! Look at the moon... Leave town before the evacuation notice is made!
477746829996466177,2014-06-14 09:38:15,You'll know you're close to a fairy who's lost in a temple if the mask's hair begins to shimmer.

476750285981749248,2014-06-11 15:38:20,"This new, sharper blade is a cut above the rest. Use it up to 100 times without dulling its superior edge!"
