523854312339165184,2014-10-19 15:12:55,@blocktogether The slowness should be fixed. Let me know if it is slow for you! - @j4cob

521275266380099585,2014-10-12 12:24:42,"@HenkPoley Right: that's spam (or SEO), not harassment. Block Together is intended to help with harassment."
521274685745811457,2014-10-12 12:22:24,@HenkPoley Probably not on the horizon since that's more of an anti-spam than anti-harassment feature. But you are welcome to fork the code!

520976291911442432,2014-10-11 16:36:41,"When clicking screen names in Block Together, do you want to link to Twitter Desktop or Twitter Mobile? Mobile = faster, but fewer features."

519214686534131712,2014-10-06 19:56:42,"@mike3k Thanks for the feedback! I chose mobile because it loads faster if you're clicking lots of links, but will consider changing."
519213629061996544,2014-10-06 19:52:30,Remember: Sometimes during a bad harassment campaign it can help to set Notifications to only 'People you follow.' http://t.co/rQSTLfD9Er
517769729080324096,2014-10-02 20:14:57,"Also coming soon to Block Together: Block lists will include account age, number of tweets, following, followers, and maybe more!"

511965066489757696,2014-09-16 19:49:18,@coleott @ADAMATOMIC @brandonnn Yep! Gotta do a deploy later today for that feature to be live. Glad to hear you're looking out for it!
509901226172243968,2014-09-11 03:08:20,New release today: Easier first-time signup; display user names on Actions page; handle deactivation; more robust new account blocking.
507984822795763712,2014-09-05 20:13:14,Previous technical difficulties with 'block new accounts (&lt; 7 days)' are fixed  (tweeting 2nd time because self-reply hidden from timeline).
504130564212137984,2014-08-26 04:57:47,@blocktogether This is now fixed.
504119110381608962,2014-08-26 04:12:16,Having some technical difficulties with the 'block new accounts (&lt; 7 days)' feature. Some may go unblocked until I fix it; apologies.
502529897865445376,2014-08-21 18:57:18,@AngryBlackLady But later visits to Notifications tab should be purged. And I'm particularly interested in fixing missed new accounts.
502529677995810816,2014-08-21 18:56:26,"@AngryBlackLady In my testing I found that even w/ instant blocks, notifications happen (unless I turn on 'replies from people I follow')."
502529400223838208,2014-08-21 18:55:20,@AngryBlackLady Sorry about the ones that slip through! Please do send examples when they happen and I'll see what I can improve.

502324387476148224,2014-08-21 05:20:41,"@gewt Gonna do a quick-fix that just increases the cycle time, and go to bed."
502324324322541568,2014-08-21 05:20:26,@gewt So it pulls in blocks that still look like they are pending even though a different callback is about to block them.
502324215610347520,2014-08-21 05:20:00,"@gewt Aha, I think I've found the source of the problem. The next queue-processing chunk happens before the previous completes."
502321566060126208,2014-08-21 05:09:28,@gewt Is this making your client unusable? Considering short-term remedies that would still leave new account auto-blocks functioning.
502321118800543744,2014-08-21 05:07:42,"@gewt Interesting. I think the bug was latent, this release tickled it by unblocking the queue."
502318593695318016,2014-08-21 04:57:40,"@gewt Thanks for the report! Just rolled back the latest release, which introduced this. Let me know if fixed?"
