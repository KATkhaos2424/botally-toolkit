936794715,2008-09-27 04:40:03,@deborazb You mean Ubiquity doesn't work on non-default Firefox themes?

935253685,2008-09-26 03:30:01,@neh Sorry to hear that. What's wrong with your Ubiquity?

929216845,2008-09-21 10:37:24,"@aikidoka Ubiquity turns ""this"" into your selection because it's more natural to do so. Pick the 2nd suggestion if you want to say ""this""."
