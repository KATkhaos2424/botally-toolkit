120617324377157632,2011-10-02 21:53:05,13. It was evening all afternoon./ It was snowing/ And it was going to snow./ The blackbird sat/ In the cedar-limbs.
120617102162927618,2011-10-02 21:52:12,12. The river is moving./ The blackbird must be flying.
120616975885021188,2011-10-02 21:51:42,"11. He rode over Connecticut/ In a glass coach./ Once, a fear pierced him,/ In that he mistook/ The shadow of his equipage/ For blackbirds."
120616731713613824,2011-10-02 21:50:44,"10. At the sight of blackbirds/ Flying in a green light,/ Even the bawds of euphony/ Would cry out sharply."
120616554391019520,2011-10-02 21:50:02,"9. When the blackbird flew out of sight,/ It marked the edge/ Of one of many circles."
120616399927377921,2011-10-02 21:49:25,"8. I know noble accents/ And lucid, inescapable rhythms;/ But I know, too,/ That the blackbird is involved/ In what I know."
120616184033980417,2011-10-02 21:48:33,"7. O thin men of Haddam,/ Why do you imagine golden birds?/ Do you not see how the blackbird/ Walks around the feet/ Of the women about you?"

120614537903878144,2011-10-02 21:42:01,4. A man and a woman/ Are one./ A man and a woman and a blackbird/ Are one.
120614359117475840,2011-10-02 21:41:18,3. The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds./ It was a small part of the pantomime.
120614028144934914,2011-10-02 21:39:59,"2. I was of three minds,/ Like a tree/ In which there are three blackbirds."
