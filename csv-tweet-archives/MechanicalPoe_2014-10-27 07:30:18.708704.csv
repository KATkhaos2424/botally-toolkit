399614144804315136,2013-11-10 19:06:51,"—and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the ""House of Usher."""
399599044701732864,2013-11-10 18:06:51,—my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder—there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters—
399583944481710080,2013-11-10 17:06:50,—there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind—the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight—
399568844236525568,2013-11-10 16:06:50,"in a zigzag direction, to the base./nSPLIT While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened—"
399553743756460033,2013-11-10 15:06:50,"through that once barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building,"
399538643272228864,2013-11-10 14:06:50,"The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly"
399523543039631360,2013-11-10 13:06:50,for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me.
399508442987393025,2013-11-10 12:06:49,"Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued;"
399493342784135168,2013-11-10 11:06:49,The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway.
399478242715123712,2013-11-10 10:06:49,"and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated. From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast."
399463142537035776,2013-11-10 09:06:49,"fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse,"
399448042312839168,2013-11-10 08:06:49,"For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold—then, with a low moaning cry,"
399432942201868288,2013-11-10 07:06:49,"There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame."
399417842225147904,2013-11-10 06:06:49,—but then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher.
399402741749264384,2013-11-10 05:06:48,It was the work of the rushing gust—
399387641227247616,2013-11-10 04:06:48,"the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony jaws."
399372540575232000,2013-11-10 03:06:48,"As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell,"
399357440082599936,2013-11-10 02:06:48,"""Madman! I tell you that she now stands without the door!"""
399342339921293312,2013-11-10 01:06:47,"Madman!""—here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul—"
399327238052904960,2013-11-10 00:06:47,Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?
399312137749004289,2013-11-09 23:06:47,Have I not heard her footstep on the stair?
399297033439571968,2013-11-09 22:06:46,Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste?
399281933076942848,2013-11-09 21:06:45,whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon?
399266828473880576,2013-11-09 20:06:44,and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh!
399251723594002432,2013-11-09 19:06:43,"—say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison,"
399236623067791360,2013-11-09 18:06:43,"—the breaking of the hermit’s door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the shield!—"
399221517487468544,2013-11-09 17:06:41,And now—to-night—Ethelred—ha! ha!—
399206414528544768,2013-11-09 16:06:40,"I heard them—many, many days ago—yet I dared not—I dared not speak!"
399191314186907648,2013-11-09 15:06:40,I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin.
399176214122074112,2013-11-09 14:06:40,Said I not that my senses were acute?
399161113893695488,2013-11-09 13:06:40,We have put her living in the tomb!
399146013744984064,2013-11-09 12:06:40,—I dared not—I dared not speak!
399130909301276672,2013-11-09 11:06:38,"Long—long—long—many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it—yet I dared not—oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!—"
399115805029564416,2013-11-09 10:06:37,"""Not hear it?—yes, I hear it, and have heard it."
399100700602662912,2013-11-09 09:06:36,"as if unconscious of my presence./nBending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words."
399085596351938560,2013-11-09 08:06:35,"a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur,"
399070496257753088,2013-11-09 07:06:35,"But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person;"
399055396125818880,2013-11-09 06:06:35,"His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity."
399040291644403712,2013-11-09 05:06:33,I rushed to the chair in which he sat.
399025187032924160,2013-11-09 04:06:32,"Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed."
399010081192546304,2013-11-09 03:06:31,"—I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled, reverberation."
398994980746055680,2013-11-09 02:06:31,"—as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver—"
398979876293976064,2013-11-09 01:06:29,"with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound./nSPLIT "" No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than—"
398964771586064384,2013-11-09 00:06:28,"which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor,"
398949666806841344,2013-11-08 23:06:27,and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall;
398934562132471808,2013-11-08 22:06:26,"and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him,"
398919461635231745,2013-11-08 21:06:25,"""And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield,"
398904360937467904,2013-11-08 20:06:25,"Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:"
398889260960735233,2013-11-08 19:06:25,—for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.
398874160438706176,2013-11-08 18:06:25,"The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea—"
398859051893006336,2013-11-08 17:06:23,from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile.
398843949466787840,2013-11-08 16:06:22,"His head had dropped upon his breast—yet I knew that he was not asleep,"
398826937126498304,2013-11-08 14:58:46,"and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly."
398811836369616896,2013-11-08 13:58:46,"From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber;"
398796735725961216,2013-11-08 12:58:45,"a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanor."
398781635241721856,2013-11-08 11:58:45,"I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly,"
398766535143333888,2013-11-08 10:58:45,"I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion."
398751434856214528,2013-11-08 09:58:45,"by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant,"
398736334925602816,2013-11-08 08:58:45,"Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence,"
398721230846840832,2013-11-08 07:58:43,—the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon’s unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.
398706130689748992,2013-11-08 06:58:43,"but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound—"
398691030616535040,2013-11-08 05:58:43,"I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant,"
398675926495805440,2013-11-08 04:58:42,"Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement—for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance,"
398660822047920129,2013-11-08 03:58:41,"that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard."""
398645716119474176,2013-11-08 02:58:39,"with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing,"
398630611663212544,2013-11-08 01:58:38,"And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath,"
398615511682281472,2013-11-08 00:58:38,"with this legend enwritten— Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin; Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win."
398600405963534336,2013-11-07 23:58:37,"which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass"
398585305848356864,2013-11-07 22:58:36,"of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, and of a fiery tongue,"
398570205871632384,2013-11-07 21:58:36,"""But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal"
398555105680957440,2013-11-07 20:58:36,which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:
398540005549023232,2013-11-07 19:58:36,"and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely,"
398524905480003584,2013-11-07 18:58:36,"It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements,"
398509804857339904,2013-11-07 17:58:36,which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described.
398494704205312000,2013-11-07 16:58:35,"in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound"
398479603318403073,2013-11-07 15:58:35,"from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly to my ears, what might have been,"
398464502817390592,2013-11-07 14:58:35,"(although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me)—it appeared to me that,"
398449402635091969,2013-11-07 13:58:35,"At the termination of this sentence I started and, for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me"
398434298069778432,2013-11-07 12:58:33,"and reverberated throughout the forest."""
398419193412218881,2013-11-07 11:58:32,"he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed"
398404093355778048,2013-11-07 10:58:32,"with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily,"
398388993274163200,2013-11-07 09:58:32,"feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and,"
398373892420820992,2013-11-07 08:58:32,"waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but,"
398358792012058624,2013-11-07 07:58:31,"and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken,"
398343691938824193,2013-11-07 06:58:31,"Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus: ""And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart,"
398328587704877056,2013-11-07 05:58:30,"having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force."
398313483684810752,2013-11-07 04:58:29,"I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist,"
398298379476008960,2013-11-07 03:58:28,"to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design."
398283279524429824,2013-11-07 02:58:28,"Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened,"
398268175315656704,2013-11-07 01:58:27,even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read.
398253068883886080,2013-11-07 00:58:25,"which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies)"
398238609020837888,2013-11-07 00:00:57,"It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement"
398223509023105024,2013-11-06 23:00:57,which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend.
398208408765362176,2013-11-06 22:00:57,"for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity"
398193308650180608,2013-11-06 21:00:57,but I had called it a favorite of Usher’s more in sad jest than in earnest;
398178206291066880,2013-11-06 20:00:56,"The antique volume which I had taken up was the ""Mad Trist"" of Sir Launcelot Canning;"
398163103160238080,2013-11-06 19:00:55,"I will read, and you shall listen:—and so we will pass away this terrible night together."""
398148002726313984,2013-11-06 18:00:55,Let us close this casement;—the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favorite romances.
398132900501422080,2013-11-06 17:00:55,—or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn.

398102700032000000,2013-11-06 15:00:54,"""You must not—you shall not behold this!"" said I, shuddering, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat."
398087599744888832,2013-11-06 14:00:54,which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.
398072494525280256,2013-11-06 13:00:53,were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation
398057390278717440,2013-11-06 12:00:52,"But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us,"
398042290197102593,2013-11-06 11:00:51,"—yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars, nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning."
398027185963151360,2013-11-06 10:00:50,I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this—
398012081867587584,2013-11-06 09:00:49,without passing away into the distance.
397996963016503296,2013-11-06 08:00:45,"did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other,"
397981863182368768,2013-11-06 07:00:44,and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house)
397966763289493504,2013-11-06 06:00:44,for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind;
397951662784258048,2013-11-06 05:00:44,A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity;
397936560953257985,2013-11-06 04:00:44,"It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty."
397921460570030080,2013-11-06 03:00:43,The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet.
397906360601686016,2013-11-06 02:00:43,"Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm."
397891260247474176,2013-11-06 01:00:43,"—""you have not then seen it?—but, stay! you shall."""
397876159922601984,2013-11-06 00:00:43,"""And you have not seen it?"" he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence—"
397861060033908736,2013-11-05 23:00:43,"His air appalled me—but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief."
397845955644764160,2013-11-05 22:00:42,—an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor.
397830855273750529,2013-11-05 21:00:41,"His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan—but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes—"
397815754944679936,2013-11-05 20:00:41,"In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp."
397800650803007488,2013-11-05 19:00:40,I presently recognized it as that of Usher.
397785549958049792,2013-11-05 18:00:40,when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention.
397770448802689024,2013-11-05 17:00:39,"by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment./nI had taken but few turns in this manner,"
397755348645601280,2013-11-05 16:00:39,"and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen,"
397740244206092288,2013-11-05 15:00:38,"I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night),"
397725144158060544,2013-11-05 14:00:38,"Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable,"

397694943105658880,2013-11-05 12:00:37,"—I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me—"
397679838875881472,2013-11-05 11:00:36,"peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened—"
397664738609737728,2013-11-05 10:00:36,"Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and,"
397649638423293952,2013-11-05 09:00:36,"An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm."
397634538274586624,2013-11-05 08:00:36,But my efforts were fruitless.
397619438155214848,2013-11-05 07:00:36,"swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed."
397604338102984704,2013-11-05 06:00:35,"the gloomy furniture of the room—of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest,"
397589238021357568,2013-11-05 05:00:35,"I endeavored to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of"
397574137990107136,2013-11-05 04:00:35,I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me.
397559037761716224,2013-11-05 03:00:35,Sleep came not near my couch—while the hours waned and waned away.
397543930491052032,2013-11-05 02:00:33,"the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings."
397530334486888448,2013-11-05 01:06:32,"It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after"
397515233176346624,2013-11-05 00:06:31,"I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions."
397500131802886144,2013-11-04 23:06:31,It was no wonder that his condition terrified—that it infected me.
397485030538498048,2013-11-04 22:06:30,"for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound."
397469928703676416,2013-11-04 21:06:30,"At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness,"
397454827405312000,2013-11-04 20:06:29,to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage.
397439726250360832,2013-11-04 19:06:29,"There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret,"
397424624990171136,2013-11-04 18:06:29,"and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance."
397409523822247936,2013-11-04 17:06:28,The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more;
397394418241916929,2013-11-04 16:06:27,"The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue—but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out."
397379317048811520,2013-11-04 15:06:26,"He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step."
397364215985750018,2013-11-04 14:06:26,His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten.
397349114939457536,2013-11-04 13:06:26,His ordinary manner had vanished.
397334013385662464,2013-11-04 12:06:25,"And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend."
397318911622148096,2013-11-04 11:06:25,into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.
397303810496139264,2013-11-04 10:06:24,"We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil,"
397288709487616000,2013-11-04 09:06:24,and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death.
397273608374210560,2013-11-04 08:06:23,"as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face,"
397258507353096192,2013-11-04 07:06:23,"The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left,"
397243406327775232,2013-11-04 06:06:23,"Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead—for we could not regard her unawed."
397228305382137857,2013-11-04 05:06:22,and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them.
397213204235173888,2013-11-04 04:06:22,"and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins,"
397198103033692160,2013-11-04 03:06:22,A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention;
397183001538605056,2013-11-04 02:06:21,"we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant."
397167900207091712,2013-11-04 01:06:21,"Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror,"
397152798091280384,2013-11-04 00:06:20,"Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp, grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges."
397137696617144320,2013-11-03 23:06:19,"The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected."
397122595445026816,2013-11-03 22:06:19,"and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper."
397107492259627008,2013-11-03 21:06:18,"as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor,"
397092391108485120,2013-11-03 20:06:18,"It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days,"

397031986461962240,2013-11-03 16:06:16,"The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest."
397016885038174209,2013-11-03 15:06:16,"At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment."
397001784058994688,2013-11-03 14:06:15,"and by no means an unnatural, precaution."
396986683163680769,2013-11-03 13:06:15,"on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless,"
396971582171918336,2013-11-03 12:06:15,"I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the staircase,"
396956481188552704,2013-11-03 11:06:14,and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family.
396941379957702656,2013-11-03 10:06:14,"of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men,"
396926278882045952,2013-11-03 09:06:14,"The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased,"
396911177877704704,2013-11-03 08:06:13,"The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute."

396865874919174144,2013-11-03 05:06:12,"when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more,"
396850774258745345,2013-11-03 04:06:12,"I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac,"

396805469249208321,2013-11-03 01:06:10,"and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and Œgipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours."

396654456542355456,2013-11-02 15:06:06,"The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent yet importunate and terrible influence"

395703072217108480,2013-10-31 00:05:38,"which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe,"
395687970780749824,2013-10-30 23:05:38,"For me at least, in the circumstances then surrounding me, there arose out of the pure abstractions"
395672869717676032,2013-10-30 22:05:38,"If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher."
395657768415555585,2013-10-30 21:05:37,"By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention."
395642667419582466,2013-10-30 20:05:37,which should lie within the compass of merely written words.
395627566293581824,2013-10-30 19:05:36,—from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion
395612465205354496,2013-10-30 18:05:36,"into vagueness at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why—"
395597362959491073,2013-10-30 17:05:35,"From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch,"
395582261925785600,2013-10-30 16:05:35,"Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber."
395567159973511168,2013-10-30 15:05:34,His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears.
395552058931412992,2013-10-30 14:05:34,"in which he involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all."
395536957876760577,2013-10-30 13:05:34,"Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations,"
395521856897568768,2013-10-30 12:05:33,I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher.
395506755759009792,2013-10-30 11:05:33,"as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom."
395491654574301184,2013-10-30 10:05:32,"the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness,"
395476553486053376,2013-10-30 09:05:32,"And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit,"
395461451126951936,2013-10-30 08:05:31,"We painted and read together, or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar."
395446348973342720,2013-10-30 07:05:31,and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend.
395431248103219200,2013-10-30 06:05:30,"For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself;"
395416147111444481,2013-10-30 05:05:30,"—that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more."
395401046090326016,2013-10-30 04:05:30,and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain—
395385945031450625,2013-10-30 03:05:29,to the prostrating power of the destroyer;
395370843788021761,2013-10-30 02:05:29,(as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation)
395355742519439360,2013-10-30 01:05:29,"but on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed"
395340641032744961,2013-10-30 00:05:28,"Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed;"
395325539416018944,2013-10-29 23:05:28,and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character were the unusual diagnosis.
395310438000648192,2013-10-29 22:05:27,"A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person,"
395295335930929152,2013-10-29 21:05:26,The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians.
395280234863669248,2013-10-29 20:05:26,had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.
395265133691559936,2013-10-29 19:05:26,"but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness"
395250032620105728,2013-10-29 18:05:25,"When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother;"
395234931477348352,2013-10-29 17:05:25,A sensation of stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps.
395219828841385984,2013-10-29 16:05:24,I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread; and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings.
395204726872371200,2013-10-29 15:05:24,"and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared."
395189625821859840,2013-10-29 14:05:23,"While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment,"
395174523773157376,2013-10-29 13:05:23,"""would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers."""
395159421904773120,2013-10-29 12:05:22,"""Her decease,"" he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget,"
395144320896221186,2013-10-29 11:05:22,"his sole companion for long years, his last and only relative on earth."
395129219724087296,2013-10-29 10:05:21,"—indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution—of a tenderly beloved sister,"
395114118661021696,2013-10-29 09:05:21,could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin—to the severe and long-continued illness—
395099017644097536,2013-10-29 08:05:21,"He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him"
395083916585222144,2013-10-29 07:05:20,"and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence."
395068815715090432,2013-10-29 06:05:20,"by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit—an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets,"
395053714597494784,2013-10-29 05:05:19,"—an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had,"
395038613559607296,2013-10-29 04:05:19,in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated—
395023512383258624,2013-10-29 03:05:19,he had never ventured forth—in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed
395008410921762817,2013-10-29 02:05:18,"He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years,"
394993309128851456,2013-10-29 01:05:18,"I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental condition."
394978207671525376,2013-10-29 00:05:17,"when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR."""
394963106042232834,2013-10-28 23:05:17,"In this unnerved, in this pitiable, condition I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive"
394948004270309376,2013-10-28 22:05:16,"I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect—in terror."
394932902955581440,2013-10-28 21:05:16,"I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul."
394917800487452672,2013-10-28 20:05:15,"I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results."
394902698308689921,2013-10-28 19:05:14,"Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost."
394887596977176576,2013-10-28 18:05:14,"""I shall perish,"" said he, ""I must perish in this deplorable folly."
394872496128020480,2013-10-28 17:05:14,To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave.
394857394020577280,2013-10-28 16:05:13,which did not inspire him with horror.
394842292982677504,2013-10-28 15:05:13,"his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments,"
394827192041226240,2013-10-28 14:05:12,he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors of all flowers were oppressive;
394812091045277696,2013-10-28 13:05:12,He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable;
394796990103822336,2013-10-28 12:05:12,"although, perhaps, the terms and the general manner of the narration had their weight."
394781888914944000,2013-10-28 11:05:11,"Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me;"
394766787902205952,2013-10-28 10:05:11,It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations.
394751686956556288,2013-10-28 09:05:10,"—a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off."
394736585935433728,2013-10-28 08:05:10,"It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy—"
394721484914311168,2013-10-28 07:05:10,"He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady."
394706383826067456,2013-10-28 06:05:09,and of the solace he expected me to afford him.
394691282796552192,2013-10-28 05:05:09,"It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me,"
394676181821562880,2013-10-28 04:05:09,"or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement."
394661080880148480,2013-10-28 03:05:08,"—that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard,"
394645979670282240,2013-10-28 02:05:08,"to that species of energetic concision—that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation—"
394630877818671104,2013-10-28 01:05:07,His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance)
394615776029573120,2013-10-28 00:05:07,His action was alternately vivacious and sullen.
394600674807521280,2013-10-27 23:05:06,and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament.
394585573639618561,2013-10-27 22:05:06,"For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits,"
394570472509435904,2013-10-27 21:05:06,—an excessive nervous agitation.
394555371265593344,2013-10-27 20:05:05,and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy—
394540270026772480,2013-10-27 19:05:05,In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence—an inconsistency;
394525168745594880,2013-10-27 18:05:04,connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.
394510067770597376,2013-10-27 17:05:04,"it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort,"
394494966254546945,2013-10-27 16:05:03,"The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture,"
394479865057255424,2013-10-27 15:05:03,"The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me."
394464763071455232,2013-10-27 14:05:02,lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke.
394449662041915392,2013-10-27 13:05:02,"And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey,"
394434561020805121,2013-10-27 12:05:02,made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten.
394419460041625600,2013-10-27 11:05:01,"—these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple,"
394404357787365376,2013-10-27 10:05:01,hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity;
394389257173086208,2013-10-27 09:05:00,"a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy;"
394374156021952512,2013-10-27 08:05:00,"a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations;"
394359054963077120,2013-10-27 07:05:00,"lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve;"
394343953920970753,2013-10-27 06:04:59,"A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison;"
394328852874682368,2013-10-27 05:04:59,Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable.
394313751887114240,2013-10-27 04:04:59,It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood.
394298650811432960,2013-10-27 03:04:58,"Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher!"
394283549731602432,2013-10-27 02:04:58,"We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe."
394268448500752384,2013-10-27 01:04:57,"A glance, however, at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity."
394253347035025408,2013-10-27 00:04:57,—of the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world.
394238245766430720,2013-10-26 23:04:57,"and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality—"
394223144611090432,2013-10-26 22:04:56,"Upon my entrance, Usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length,"
394208043732570112,2013-10-26 21:04:56,"An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all."
394192942359130112,2013-10-26 20:04:55,I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.
394177841254109184,2013-10-26 19:04:55,"Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene."
394162740212035584,2013-10-26 18:04:55,"The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered."
394147639182508032,2013-10-26 17:04:54,or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls.
394132538199117824,2013-10-26 16:04:54,"the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber,"
394117437354168320,2013-10-26 15:04:54,"Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct"
394102336081379328,2013-10-26 14:04:53,altogether inaccessible from within.
394087235399991296,2013-10-26 13:04:53,"The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be"
394072134420824064,2013-10-26 12:04:53,The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.
394057033450000384,2013-10-26 11:04:52,The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.
394041932571496448,2013-10-26 10:04:52,"His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation and passed on."
394026831554576384,2013-10-26 09:04:51,"On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family."
394011730734776321,2013-10-26 08:04:51,—I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up.
393996630154031104,2013-10-26 07:04:51,—while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this—
393981529099370496,2013-10-26 06:04:51,"were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy—"
393966428115976192,2013-10-26 05:04:50,"the ebon blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode,"
393951327367487488,2013-10-26 04:04:50,"While the objects around me—while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls,"
393936226287632385,2013-10-26 03:04:49,"Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken."
393921125446864896,2013-10-26 02:04:49,through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master.
393906023897255936,2013-10-26 01:04:49,"A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence,"
393890922205024256,2013-10-26 00:04:48,"A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall."
393875820928053248,2013-10-25 23:04:48,"until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn. Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house."
393860720041160704,2013-10-25 22:04:47,"extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction,"
393845618902568960,2013-10-25 21:04:47,"Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which,"
393830517885636608,2013-10-25 20:04:47,"Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability."
393815416868708352,2013-10-25 19:04:46,"in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air."
393800315847589889,2013-10-25 18:04:46,In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years
393785214809702400,2013-10-25 17:04:46,and the crumbling condition of the individual stones.

393755012570304512,2013-10-25 15:04:45,Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation.
393739911557562368,2013-10-25 14:04:44,"Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves."
393724810599350272,2013-10-25 13:04:44,The discoloration of ages had been great.
393709709611786240,2013-10-25 12:04:44,Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.
393694608649371649,2013-10-25 11:04:43,"Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building."
393679507682787328,2013-10-25 10:04:43,"and the silent tarn—a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued."
393664406175113216,2013-10-25 09:04:43,"—an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall,"
393649304524849152,2013-10-25 08:04:42,there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity—
393634203461758977,2013-10-25 07:04:42,I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain
393619102579056640,2013-10-25 06:04:41,"—a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me."
393604001591480320,2013-10-25 05:04:41,there grew in my mind a strange fancy—
393588900587130880,2013-10-25 04:04:41,"And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool,"
393573799528235008,2013-10-25 03:04:40,"Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis."
393558698469384192,2013-10-25 02:04:40,—served mainly to accelerate the increase itself.
393543597192384513,2013-10-25 01:04:39,There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition—for why should I not so term it?—
393528495282065408,2013-10-25 00:04:39,-had been to deepen the first singular impression.
393513394256756736,2013-10-24 23:04:38,I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment—that of looking down within the tarn-
393498293076238336,2013-10-24 22:04:38,"—an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion."
393483191849590784,2013-10-24 21:04:38,"in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the ""House of Usher""—"
393468090501304320,2013-10-24 20:04:37,"which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate"
393452989471797248,2013-10-24 19:04:37,"and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name,"
393437888530370560,2013-10-24 18:04:37,"in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other—it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue,"
393422787513417728,2013-10-24 17:04:36,"with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one,"
393407686421016576,2013-10-24 16:04:36,"It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises"
393392585466986498,2013-10-24 15:04:35,"with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain."
393377484227747840,2013-10-24 14:04:35,"at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always,"
393362383168876544,2013-10-24 13:04:35,"I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth,"
393347282130964480,2013-10-24 12:04:34,"perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties, of musical science."
393332181105659904,2013-10-24 11:04:34,"in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies,"
393317080050987008,2013-10-24 10:04:34,"displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late,"
393301979071791105,2013-10-24 09:04:33,"I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament,"
393286878272970752,2013-10-24 08:04:33,His reserve had been always excessive and habitual.
393271777272815616,2013-10-24 07:04:32,"Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend."
393256676297809920,2013-10-24 06:04:32,and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.
393241575658381312,2013-10-24 05:04:32,—it was the apparent heart that went with his request—which allowed me no room for hesitation;
393226474712743936,2013-10-24 04:04:32,"some alleviation of his malady./nSPLIT It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said—"
393211373750341632,2013-10-24 03:04:31,"as his best and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society,"
393196272699854848,2013-10-24 02:04:31,"The writer spoke of acute bodily illness—of a mental disorder which oppressed him—and of an earnest desire to see me,"
393181170969878528,2013-10-24 01:04:30,had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation.
393166069139259393,2013-10-24 00:04:30,"A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country—a letter from him—which, in its wildly importunate nature,"
393150967644176384,2013-10-23 23:04:29,"Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting."
393135866300084224,2013-10-23 22:04:29,"Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks."
393120759385964545,2013-10-23 21:04:27,"and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows."
393105657542766592,2013-10-23 20:04:26,"and gazed down—but with a shudder even more thrilling than before—upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge,"
393090554579677184,2013-10-23 19:04:26,"I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling,"
393075451708846080,2013-10-23 18:04:25,"would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea,"
393060350683516929,2013-10-23 17:04:24,"It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture,"
393045248295067648,2013-10-23 16:04:24,still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth.
393030147609477120,2013-10-23 15:04:23,"there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us,"
393015046684811264,2013-10-23 14:04:23,"I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt,"
392999945923756032,2013-10-23 13:04:23,It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered.
392984844835500032,2013-10-23 12:04:22,What was it—I paused to think—what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher?
392969743826944000,2013-10-23 11:04:22,which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime.
392954641878896640,2013-10-23 10:04:22,"There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart—an unredeemed dreariness of thought"
392939539876306944,2013-10-23 09:04:21,the after-dream of the reveller upon opium—the bitter lapse into every-day life—the hideous dropping off of the veil.
392924438838398976,2013-10-23 08:04:21,—with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to
392909337813090304,2013-10-23 07:04:20,—upon the bleak walls—upon the vacant eye-like windows—upon a few rank sedges—and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees—
392894236162797568,2013-10-23 06:04:20,"I looked upon the scene before me—upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain—"
392879135196217344,2013-10-23 05:04:19,with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible.
392864033210380288,2013-10-23 04:04:19,"I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment,"
392848932113747968,2013-10-23 03:04:18,"I know not how it was—but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit."
392833830559973376,2013-10-23 02:04:18,"and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher."
392818728683196416,2013-10-23 01:04:17,"I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country,"
392803624457617408,2013-10-23 00:04:16,"DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens,"

387274449500012545,2013-10-07 17:53:18,Was it possible they heard not?
387259349498068992,2013-10-07 16:53:18,"And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled."
387244249382928384,2013-10-07 15:53:18,It grew louder—louder—louder!
387229149582336000,2013-10-07 14:53:18,"I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased."
387214048322129920,2013-10-07 13:53:17,Oh God! what could I do? I foamed—I raved—I swore!
387198948022431744,2013-10-07 12:53:17,"I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men—but the noise steadily increased."
387183847039062016,2013-10-07 11:53:17,Why would they not be gone?
387168745925664768,2013-10-07 10:53:16,"I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased."
387153646317993984,2013-10-07 09:53:16,I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased.
387138546441924609,2013-10-07 08:53:16,I gasped for breath—and yet the officers heard it not.
387123445085253632,2013-10-07 07:53:16,"It was a low, dull, quick sound—much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton."
387108345070780417,2013-10-07 06:53:16,Yet the sound increased—and what could I do?
387093243911241728,2013-10-07 05:53:15,"—but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice."
387078142160285696,2013-10-07 04:53:15,"—until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears./nNo doubt I now grew very pale;—"
387063039201406976,2013-10-07 03:53:14,I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness—
387047933826584577,2013-10-07 02:53:13,The ringing became more distinct:—It continued and became more distinct:
387032833493307392,2013-10-07 01:53:12,"My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted."
387017733659176960,2013-10-07 00:53:12,"But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone."
387002632436731904,2013-10-06 23:53:12,"They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things."
386987532623572993,2013-10-06 22:53:12,The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease.
386972432667799552,2013-10-06 21:53:12,placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.
386957332758151168,2013-10-06 20:53:12,"while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph,"
386942232525565953,2013-10-06 19:53:11,"In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues,"
386925874609934336,2013-10-06 18:48:11,"I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed."
386910774788362240,2013-10-06 17:48:11,I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search—search well.
386895674689978368,2013-10-06 16:48:11,"The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country."
386880574516125696,2013-10-06 15:48:11,"The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream."
386865474631643136,2013-10-06 14:48:11,"I smiled,—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome."
386850374478753793,2013-10-06 13:48:11,"information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises."
386835274728505344,2013-10-06 12:48:11,A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused;
386820170523893760,2013-10-06 11:48:10,"There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police."
386805065925021696,2013-10-06 10:48:08,"I went down to open it with a light heart,—for what had I now to fear?"
386789965889540096,2013-10-06 09:48:08,"As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door."
386774866361585664,2013-10-06 08:48:08,"When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock—still dark as midnight."
386759762014384128,2013-10-06 07:48:07,I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all—ha! ha!
386744657583304704,2013-10-06 06:48:06,There was nothing to wash out—no stain of any kind—no blood-spot whatever.
386729557887574016,2013-10-06 05:48:06,"I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could have detected any thing wrong."
386714458271526913,2013-10-06 04:48:06,"I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings."
386699358106034176,2013-10-06 03:48:06,First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.
386684258234138624,2013-10-06 02:48:06,"The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence."
386669153090019328,2013-10-06 01:48:04,"If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body."
386654052974870529,2013-10-06 00:48:04,There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.
386626884869820416,2013-10-05 23:00:07,I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes.
386611788345004032,2013-10-05 22:00:07,"I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead."
386596692193476608,2013-10-05 21:00:08,At length it ceased. The old man was dead.
386581596524261376,2013-10-05 20:00:09,"This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall."
386566501014441984,2013-10-05 19:00:10,"But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound."
386551405131337729,2013-10-05 18:00:11,"I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done."
386536304781324288,2013-10-05 17:00:11,"In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him."
386521209158262785,2013-10-05 16:00:12,"With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once—once only."
386506113556180993,2013-10-05 15:00:13,The old man's hour had come!
386491017387843584,2013-10-05 14:00:13,And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be heard by a neighbour!
386475921978691584,2013-10-05 13:00:14,I thought the heart must burst.
386460826162700288,2013-10-05 12:00:15,"But the beating grew louder, louder!"
386445730728390657,2013-10-05 11:00:16,"Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still."
386430634870456320,2013-10-05 10:00:17,so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror.
386415538781818880,2013-10-05 09:00:18,"And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house,"
386400438784110592,2013-10-05 08:00:18,"It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!—do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am."
386385342758400000,2013-10-05 07:00:19,The old man's terror must have been extreme!
386370242576154624,2013-10-05 06:00:18,"It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant."
386355146630115328,2013-10-05 05:00:19,Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased.
386340046573674496,2013-10-05 04:00:19,I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve.
386324951147773952,2013-10-05 03:00:20,But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless.
386309855180754945,2013-10-05 02:00:21,"It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage."
386294759620624384,2013-10-05 01:00:22,It was the beating of the old man's heart.
386279659434172416,2013-10-05 00:00:22,"I knew that sound well, too."
386264563945332736,2013-10-04 23:00:23,"—now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton."
386249467890270208,2013-10-04 22:00:23,And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense?—
386234372405608448,2013-10-04 21:00:24,"for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot."
386219276639956992,2013-10-04 20:00:25,but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person:
386204181184667648,2013-10-04 19:00:26,"I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones;"
386189085322522625,2013-10-04 18:00:27,"It was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I gazed upon it."
386173989758185473,2013-10-04 17:00:28,"like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye."
386158889643044864,2013-10-04 16:00:28,"So I opened it—you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily—until, at length a simple dim ray,"
386143794141593600,2013-10-04 15:00:29,"—a very, very little crevice in the lantern."
386128698078162944,2013-10-04 14:00:30,"When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little—"
386113602056630272,2013-10-04 13:00:31,—although he neither saw nor heard—to feel the presence of my head within the room.
386098495746490368,2013-10-04 12:00:29,And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel—
386083386772959232,2013-10-04 11:00:27,"All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim."
386068291384770561,2013-10-04 10:00:28,"Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain."
386053195585560576,2013-10-04 09:00:29,"or ""It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp."""
386038095407509504,2013-10-04 08:00:28,"He had been saying to himself—""It is nothing but the wind in the chimney—it is only a mouse crossing the floor,"""
386023000086433792,2013-10-04 07:00:29,"He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not."
386007898952040448,2013-10-04 06:00:29,His fears had been ever since growing upon him.
385992803312205824,2013-10-04 05:00:30,"I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed."
385977703394213888,2013-10-04 04:00:30,"I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart."
385962607439785985,2013-10-04 03:00:31,"deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well."
385947511955152896,2013-10-04 02:00:32,"Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom,"
385932415912656896,2013-10-04 01:00:32,when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well.
385917315554246656,2013-10-04 00:00:32,"It was not a groan of pain or of grief—oh, no!—it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul"
385902219390107648,2013-10-03 23:00:33,"Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror."
385887123620265984,2013-10-03 22:00:34,"He was still sitting up in the bed listening;—just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall."
385872028005597184,2013-10-03 21:00:35,"For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down."
385856932474789888,2013-10-03 20:00:36,"and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out—""Who's there?"" I kept quite still and said nothing."
385841836247756800,2013-10-03 19:00:37,"I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening,"
385826740817637376,2013-10-03 18:00:37,"and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily."
385811645458825216,2013-10-03 17:00:38,"His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,)"
385796549718343680,2013-10-03 16:00:39,Now you may think that I drew back—but no.
385781453797490688,2013-10-03 15:00:40,"I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled."
385766358333800448,2013-10-03 14:00:41,"To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts."
385751262282915840,2013-10-03 13:00:42,I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph.
385736166601146368,2013-10-03 12:00:43,A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers—of my sagacity.
385721070642528256,2013-10-03 11:00:44,I looked in upon him while he slept. Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door.
385705974788788224,2013-10-03 10:00:45,"So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve,"
385690879497105408,2013-10-03 09:00:46,"calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night."
385675783983099904,2013-10-03 08:00:47,"And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him,"
385660688192241664,2013-10-03 07:00:47,"—but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye."
385645592388845568,2013-10-03 06:00:48,And this I did for seven long nights—every night just at midnight—
385630496488980480,2013-10-03 05:00:49,—I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye.
385615400559726592,2013-10-03 04:00:50,"—oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the hinges creaked)—"
385600304987004928,2013-10-03 03:00:51,"Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously—"
385585209137451008,2013-10-03 02:00:52,It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed.
385569920769327104,2013-10-03 01:00:07,"I moved it slowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep."
385554772163850240,2013-10-02 23:59:55,"Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in!"
385539675861319680,2013-10-02 22:59:56,"closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head."
385524579852365824,2013-10-02 21:59:57,"And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed,"
385509483965079552,2013-10-02 20:59:58,"And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh so gently!"
385494383816343552,2013-10-02 19:59:57,I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.
385479288486912000,2013-10-02 18:59:58,You should have seen how wisely I proceeded—with what caution—with what foresight—with what dissimulation I went to work!
385464192591200256,2013-10-02 17:59:59,But you should have seen me.
385449096552939520,2013-10-02 17:00:00,Madmen know nothing.
385434001110204416,2013-10-02 16:00:01,Now this is the point. You fancy me mad.
385418900894404608,2013-10-02 15:00:01,"—I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever."
385403804977745920,2013-10-02 14:00:02,"Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees—very gradually—"
385388704732545024,2013-10-02 13:00:02,"He had the eye of a vulture—a pale blue eye, with a film over it."
385373604592238592,2013-10-02 12:00:01,"I think it was his eye! yes, it was this!"
385358509053083648,2013-10-02 11:00:02,I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire.
385343409453817856,2013-10-02 10:00:02,Object there was none. Passion there was none.
385328314153705472,2013-10-02 09:00:03,"It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night."
385313208724369409,2013-10-02 08:00:02,and observe how healthily—how calmly I can tell you the whole story.
385298112883195904,2013-10-02 07:00:03,"How, then, am I mad? Hearken!"
385283017327267840,2013-10-02 06:00:04,I heard many things in hell.
385267921423183872,2013-10-02 05:00:05,I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth.
385252821459013632,2013-10-02 04:00:04,Above all was the sense of hearing acute.
385251962016772096,2013-10-02 03:56:40,The disease had sharpened my senses—not destroyed—not dulled them.
385251638619168768,2013-10-02 03:55:22,"TRUE!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?"
