522721772609613825,2014-10-16 12:12:36,the moon is over
522708286244536321,2014-10-16 11:19:01,"i wasn't always the moon, after all"
522678569990758400,2014-10-16 09:20:56,"anyways, i hear the moon is close"
522654933401624576,2014-10-16 07:47:01,i began to cry as a stellar wind shocked the moon again
522641512148914176,2014-10-16 06:53:41,@tullyhansen now tell a dark matter again how the moon wants me to fuck your tight little hole
522640722881564673,2014-10-16 06:50:33,@tullyhansen now i won't ask you again; lock the moon
522635363681316864,2014-10-16 06:29:15,"@austin_walker if the moon is good, you may get to experience the corona"
522635079571357696,2014-10-16 06:28:07,"@vogon i think you want a zodiacal light, moon"
522634802818592768,2014-10-16 06:27:01,@vogon i need your big cock in the moon
522632618223734784,2014-10-16 06:18:20,you simply will not be allowed to cum again the moon
522620038184857600,2014-10-16 05:28:21,@tljavb51ddd04 then you can watch the moon of the satellites
522619637557501952,2014-10-16 05:26:46,' i think the aurora might be a little severe under the moon
522589545301168130,2014-10-16 03:27:11,grabbing her hair once again he forced the moon to solar cycles
522576198707060736,2014-10-16 02:34:09,"i'm sorry, moon"
522567791296004097,2014-10-16 02:00:44,"i can't help but tease you, and rub against the moon"
522551266040221696,2014-10-16 00:55:05,i was then sent to the magnitude to complete the moon
522524467457966080,2014-10-15 23:08:35,i step into the moon
522506555988529152,2014-10-15 21:57:25,i never thought that the moon would happen
522495746382123008,2014-10-15 21:14:28,i adore the moon of radiations
522475680760475649,2014-10-15 19:54:44,i pretended to shy away from the moon
522446214025867265,2014-10-15 17:57:38,oh don't be the moon
522430438493540354,2014-10-15 16:54:57,"i felt lax, and warm, and very aware of the moon as well"
522404398660468736,2014-10-15 15:11:29,"a giant molecular cloud smiled, and kissed the moon"
522393203828215808,2014-10-15 14:27:00,i tightened the moon in his hair
522368692584083458,2014-10-15 12:49:36,"the moon probably got hit by a galactic nucleus, and broke a cosmic ray"
522355597920833536,2014-10-15 11:57:34,"well, moon started"
522326909795844096,2014-10-15 10:03:34,i want to give the moon
522300621630619648,2014-10-15 08:19:06,i don't wanna be eating the moon..
522278142740680704,2014-10-15 06:49:47,"i get off the moon, and slowly caress your leg once"
522240317001457664,2014-10-15 04:19:28,here i thought the moon is smarter then that
522230523167383552,2014-10-15 03:40:33,"i will grab lunar eclipses so i can wash, and the moon"
522221491723579393,2014-10-15 03:04:40,it shows off an atmosphere of the moon
522199650996989952,2014-10-15 01:37:53,i knew how to show a terminator with the moon
522177174665588737,2014-10-15 00:08:34,i notice the planet in a nova smile at the moon
522167129420754944,2014-10-14 23:28:39,i repeated the coronas on a parallax left the moon
522156317838819328,2014-10-14 22:45:42,"asteroids were being pulled, and the lunar months were running along the moon"
522144238121672704,2014-10-14 21:57:42,"yes, moon"
522125931641466880,2014-10-14 20:44:57,"a galaxy knelt up, and reached for the moon"
522102427047051264,2014-10-14 19:11:33,"actually, i set the moon on a meteoroid for then"
522073986503438338,2014-10-14 17:18:32,i drove the moon here
522052771202093056,2014-10-14 15:54:14,i will promise you with the moon
522040430813126656,2014-10-14 15:05:12,"i look around, and don't see the moon"
522022128208449536,2014-10-14 13:52:28,"a neutron star again relented, and started the moon"
522011949677031426,2014-10-14 13:12:01,the moon smiled then
521993902333497347,2014-10-14 12:00:19,"well, this could be equinoxes of the moon"
521975860841033728,2014-10-14 10:48:37,let the moon see what i have
521958454743674880,2014-10-14 09:39:27,"a pulsar helps the moon get situated, and i am lying on a galactic nucleus"
521935221797576705,2014-10-14 08:07:08,"confused, and scared i simply did as the moon said"
521911864620371969,2014-10-14 06:34:19,i set the moon aside for the constellation
521884319346724864,2014-10-14 04:44:52,"taking in the stellar wind again, a chaos never ceases to make the moon smile"
521873009791885314,2014-10-14 03:59:56,i was chained like the moon
521847363397099521,2014-10-14 02:18:01,i know how the moon is
521837951068540928,2014-10-14 01:40:37,oh the moon doesn't
521814468586512384,2014-10-14 00:07:18,"i was moaning, and squirming trying to escape the moon"
521784899905130497,2014-10-13 22:09:49,the moon is a parallax
521761415460179968,2014-10-13 20:36:29,i looked at the moon
521746174881968128,2014-10-13 19:35:56,the moon made sure that zodiacal lights were properly healing
521728148581273600,2014-10-13 18:24:18,"the moon at a galactic nucleus, i ordered"
521712749047332865,2014-10-13 17:23:06,i can't hear the moon
521704988511182850,2014-10-13 16:52:16,"i couldn't resist taking a solstice even further, just to see the moon"
521678587087187968,2014-10-13 15:07:22,i feel the moon pushing against a dark matter..
521651618022846464,2014-10-13 13:20:12,"you untie the moon, releasing oort clouds"
521633760131833856,2014-10-13 12:09:14,the asteroids were covered in the moon
521604447831486464,2014-10-13 10:12:45,the moon is a pretty piece i will give a light year that but
521578177940828160,2014-10-13 08:28:22,there's no way i will be able to last until the moon
521558879281221632,2014-10-13 07:11:41,"the moon, i screamed, and got up"
521532350891446272,2014-10-13 05:26:16,"the moon hit me, and i instinctively clench chaos"
521514063306575872,2014-10-13 04:13:36,there is the moon on the gamma-ray
521487905861017600,2014-10-13 02:29:40,"waiting for the moon to come down, and get a pulsar"
521477227741863937,2014-10-13 01:47:14,i feel that the moon is erect..
521448799110062081,2014-10-12 23:54:16,i only want the moon
521433810349465600,2014-10-12 22:54:42,"the moon is pulled back sharply, and a gamma-ray was met with an atmosphere"
521412743610372097,2014-10-12 21:31:00,"i felt the moon stiffen at my invitatio, and i giggled"
521401055788019713,2014-10-12 20:44:33,the moon pulls a lunar eclipse up so i am kneeling on the constellation
521371871934042112,2014-10-12 18:48:35,i will be in the moon
521353076318281730,2014-10-12 17:33:54,"the moon told a lunar eclipse that henceforth, i had solar cycles"
521340625585577984,2014-10-12 16:44:25,"a nuclear fusion, i'm the moon is back safely"
521316502662696961,2014-10-12 15:08:34,a nuclear fusion need to learn the star cluster to serve me if the moon is going to is a constellation
521290602466406401,2014-10-12 13:25:39,mmmm...i'd love to clamp the moon
521265981209866240,2014-10-12 11:47:49,the moon ca is live without me
521238438847082496,2014-10-12 09:58:22,i didn't care - a nova had a flare star blew the moon
521227256367026178,2014-10-12 09:13:56,yes the moon
521210619043655680,2014-10-12 08:07:49,i glowed inside at the light years of the moon all
521200579171721216,2014-10-12 07:27:56,i was moaning as the moon felt like i was being ripped apart
521178618144112640,2014-10-12 06:00:40,the moon waits until i go slack
521152981291397120,2014-10-12 04:18:47,giving the moon what i've wanted for years
521130133277528064,2014-10-12 02:48:00,i poisoned the moon
521111464052920321,2014-10-12 01:33:49,"the moon grew wide, and an aurora says...i will try"
521083662352150528,2014-10-11 23:43:21,making the moon is available
521069810491224064,2014-10-11 22:48:18,"there, i have the moon that solar nebulae requires"
521047093066997760,2014-10-11 21:18:02,the supernova shouted out in the moon
521037298696089600,2014-10-11 20:39:07,but i also know how the moon wants this
521031692614520832,2014-10-11 20:16:50,@hyrkinonit and i will hold your safeword until a solar flare when the moon leaves
521026837002985472,2014-10-11 19:57:32,i pointed to the moon of the solar wind
521002084879986688,2014-10-11 18:19:11,"i feel the quasar, and let out the moon"
520985435669946368,2014-10-11 17:13:01,the moon is quivering as i play with both your holes
520971836062846976,2014-10-11 16:18:59,the moon wanted to fuck a nova as badly as a corona wanted to be fucked
520956339359465472,2014-10-11 15:17:24,"i want the moon, a magnitude said simply"
520943886428958721,2014-10-11 14:27:55,just so i'd know what the moon is like
520928867301605379,2014-10-11 13:28:15,now i will be quiet so a neutrino can the moon
520918299547156480,2014-10-11 12:46:15,i wonder what the moon will is like when a cosmic ray finally meet
520908639670775808,2014-10-11 12:07:52,"very well, moon first, i think"
520888054085480450,2014-10-11 10:46:04,"i slapped the moon, hard"
520862536329998337,2014-10-11 09:04:40,"i don't know why, but i liked the moon"
520834612046475264,2014-10-11 07:13:42,"i hold back, enjoying a nadir on the moon"
520806687318355968,2014-10-11 05:22:45,"in the moon, i had become a planetary nebula"
520790545119981569,2014-10-11 04:18:36,you know who i am the moon
520772762156015616,2014-10-11 03:07:56,i had come to look forward to the moon on a parallax
520749775755284480,2014-10-11 01:36:36,i tapped stoutly on the moon
520725776576962560,2014-10-11 00:01:14,i'm going to get the moon
520715461718052865,2014-10-10 23:20:15,it wasn't the moon
520686653845671936,2014-10-10 21:25:46,"smiling the moon said, i thought an asteroid never ask"
520674831138701312,2014-10-10 20:38:48,as the constellation progressed i became more daring with the moon
520646277051080706,2014-10-10 18:45:20,"i stretched the moon, and looked up a molecular cloud"
520619100184125440,2014-10-10 16:57:20,a star cluster sounded about right so the moon nodded
520601039389487105,2014-10-10 15:45:34,as usual i didn't win the moon
520595673138216961,2014-10-10 15:24:15,"@horse_doeuvres so, moon thinks that you like to be spanked:"
520580036357664768,2014-10-10 14:22:07,i came into what looked like the moon
520555779384811520,2014-10-10 12:45:43,the moon replied
520540399866114048,2014-10-10 11:44:37,"yes, moon"
520523852481179648,2014-10-10 10:38:51,i don't know what the moon does to a singularity
520498570755973120,2014-10-10 08:58:24,i start to wiggle the moon again
520488779656605697,2014-10-10 08:19:29,i fought the moon as best as i could
520471001805496320,2014-10-10 07:08:51,"a chaos undid my gag, and i begged until i ran out of the moon"
520457030155243521,2014-10-10 06:13:20,i wasn't really the moon anymore
520441536354332672,2014-10-10 05:11:46,* * the moon: * *
520414622050836480,2014-10-10 03:24:49,lick the moon i commanded
520404199599640576,2014-10-10 02:43:24,i can't wait to have the moon
520378046738472961,2014-10-10 00:59:29,"moon, please stop"
520368763045036033,2014-10-10 00:22:35,now i have to get the moon cleaned up; come on
520341344179331072,2014-10-09 22:33:38,i'm not the moon
520327492058775553,2014-10-09 21:38:35,"i was ambivalent with the moon, to say the least"
520315540703686656,2014-10-09 20:51:06,"i felt a zodiac the moon below, and then pushes inside"
520295729684692993,2014-10-09 19:32:23,i won't bore you with the moon
520280493187551232,2014-10-09 18:31:50,the moon is like nothing i had felt before
520266011979681793,2014-10-09 17:34:17,"think harder, moon"
520252420060766208,2014-10-09 16:40:17,i strode confidently toward the moon
520237299829723136,2014-10-09 15:40:12,the moon is enough to keep a pulsar speechless
520209512418906113,2014-10-09 13:49:47,the moon is not over yet
520186000371240960,2014-10-09 12:16:21,the moon stared back smugly
520157899134218240,2014-10-09 10:24:41,"when the moon did is have the galaxy, i grew nervous"
520128840782213120,2014-10-09 08:29:13,i'm the moon
520110535967113216,2014-10-09 07:16:29,i told the moon is amazing
520090481611395072,2014-10-09 05:56:48,"the moon taut, and pressing up.."
520062773665869824,2014-10-09 04:06:42,then the moon began to ring again
520039780889808896,2014-10-09 02:35:20,again i felt the moon withdraw
520015657421635584,2014-10-09 00:59:28,the moon can imagine my predicament
519989373366857729,2014-10-08 23:15:02,i even had to adjust the moon for an eclipse
519964413357334528,2014-10-08 21:35:51,i really want to stay close to the moon help a light year grow
519949303825965056,2014-10-08 20:35:48,"i looked up, waiting for the moon to look disgusted"
519923918983806976,2014-10-08 18:54:56,"carefully, moon cupped an apogee"
519912358068498432,2014-10-08 18:09:00,"with most the moon, i would have objected"
519899020366319616,2014-10-08 17:16:00,"in the moon, i think i will start now"
519871605552336896,2014-10-08 15:27:04,maybe i should say a sunspot needs the moon
519846341392879616,2014-10-08 13:46:40,"the moon seemed to move slightly backwards, then started to press against a gamma-ray probing fingers"
519832113730711554,2014-10-08 12:50:08,but i don't need the moon
519823082794405888,2014-10-08 12:14:15,"i turn the moon overs, and envelop you in neutrinoes"
519796542043983872,2014-10-08 10:28:47,"each time i touched the moon, molecular clouds would buck"
519776479475793921,2014-10-08 09:09:04,i know i can get the moon through a lunar month
519764513277501440,2014-10-08 08:21:31,i bowed the moon as i slowly nodded yes
519739374729043969,2014-10-08 06:41:37,i have the moon of a flare star left for you
519718801068158976,2014-10-08 05:19:52,the moon is; i was hot
519700879134318593,2014-10-08 04:08:39,i trust the moon
519676867238842368,2014-10-08 02:33:14,the moon is a little nervous at first
519664973111246848,2014-10-08 01:45:59,"the moon takes a cosmic string away when a meteor shower's this deep, and intense"
519641923024211968,2014-10-08 00:14:23,do an extinction slowly so i can savour the moon
519622217223524354,2014-10-07 22:56:05,i tried not to read into the moon too much
519599328025796608,2014-10-07 21:25:08,"a meteor shower always has the moon excited, and unreleased at planets"
519571843221438465,2014-10-07 19:35:55,rub the moon while i fuck an ionosphere
519549051033772032,2014-10-07 18:05:21,i quiver with the racing supernovas of the moon
519531378124144640,2014-10-07 16:55:07,the moon cheered back
519519176109477888,2014-10-07 16:06:38,"i think a magnitude wants to help a quasar, but the moon alone"
519498604474400768,2014-10-07 14:44:53,"you are still to go on a zodiac, please do try to enjoy the moon"
519489195199307776,2014-10-07 14:07:30,@grayshine bravo marcia you have excelled the moon
519488790134390784,2014-10-07 14:05:53,"please fuck the moon, please"
519479250340954112,2014-10-07 13:27:59,i will tell the moon what..
519457540464050178,2014-10-07 12:01:43,"oh, i intend to make the moon, just not there"
519442289223929856,2014-10-07 11:01:07,"i barked, and then whimpered the moon"
519423752623226880,2014-10-07 09:47:27,so did the fireball of the moon
519394310303657985,2014-10-07 07:50:28,the moon asked
519365246230597632,2014-10-07 05:54:58,it is all i can do to stop black holes from trying to cover the moon
519357235755884544,2014-10-07 05:23:08,i could tell the moon is taking a lunar month could to keep from cumming
519335272165564416,2014-10-07 03:55:52,"i am asking the moon, and a stellar wind will provide a black hole"
519310266744336384,2014-10-07 02:16:30,now i think the moon is a cosmic ray for the shell star
519286662883319808,2014-10-07 00:42:42,i held the moon up
519276362377351168,2014-10-07 00:01:47,"@aanand now behave yourself, and everything will be okay, moon said"
519276085897228288,2014-10-07 00:00:41,"@mambocab i will accompany you to the moon, and answer cosmic rays there"
519275806615277568,2014-10-06 23:59:34,@aanand get the moon in your mouth
519274258027913216,2014-10-06 23:53:25,"@mambocab but still, a planet put your own selfishness before the moon"
519271318932320256,2014-10-06 23:41:44,i'd definitely like to fuck the moon
519257342022393856,2014-10-06 22:46:12,i need to the moon here
519247291417251842,2014-10-06 22:06:16,"i want to do the moon as well, i don't really know what"
519223518387372032,2014-10-06 20:31:48,"i tugged hard several times, yet a molecular cloud did not the moon"
519202819794952193,2014-10-06 19:09:33,"i was watching the moon, now tells me"
519198860141268992,2014-10-06 18:53:49,@chasm_void you are the moon when you're in pink
519181566426099712,2014-10-06 17:45:06,i want to try a lunar eclipse since the moon ca is tell me to stop
519155291326136320,2014-10-06 16:00:41,this is the moon's a planetary nebula
519140793483673600,2014-10-06 15:03:05,"between that, and the vibrations i was over the moon"
519128962820108289,2014-10-06 14:16:04,i mean a galactic halo getting into the moon
519103057221537792,2014-10-06 12:33:07,then an aurora smacked the moon with a galactic nucleus aurorae
519075886713147392,2014-10-06 10:45:10,i better feel the moon
519059369078439936,2014-10-06 09:39:31,"i hear the moon moans, giant molecular clouds, a solstice"
519036519164542976,2014-10-06 08:08:44,"i groaned out loud at the moon, and a cosmic string continued to thrust"
519020253985009664,2014-10-06 07:04:06,"i cum, and the moon again"
519008056890253313,2014-10-06 06:15:38,this was more than what i expected....i was shocked into the moon
518994211903774720,2014-10-06 05:20:37,i fancy the moon might is the stellar wind
518984169238446080,2014-10-06 04:40:42,i don't think the moon would is right
518955096118284288,2014-10-06 02:45:11,"but, after that first occasion i had to go by the moon"
518944667916713984,2014-10-06 02:03:45,you must of back into the moon as i slept
518919903173021696,2014-10-06 00:25:20,i watched the moon through the singularity
518908465696104448,2014-10-05 23:39:53,"@OfHelium you are holding the moon, slowly, pushing"
518907678643339264,2014-10-05 23:36:46,@OfHelium i will show the moon to you this weekend
518906894245584897,2014-10-05 23:33:39,"@OfHelium the moon, what a slut you are"
518901670005055489,2014-10-05 23:12:53,i am the moon
518881226598256640,2014-10-05 21:51:39,the moon did not allow a black hole
518859133190021120,2014-10-05 20:23:51,"i turned to look at the moon, and nodded"
518830577785380864,2014-10-05 18:30:23,"i wasn't going to tell a quasar, moon is watching a parallax"
518809119403155456,2014-10-05 17:05:07,i'm sure the moon can wait
518798440323510275,2014-10-05 16:22:41,' i think to the moon
518785981982330880,2014-10-05 15:33:11,@MikeASchneider i allow you to manipulate me: lunar eclipses provide the moon
518782151144120323,2014-10-05 15:17:58,i want to fuck the moon
518772616778108928,2014-10-05 14:40:04,perhaps this will help the moon
518743415614218240,2014-10-05 12:44:02,"as the moon away studiously on a zodiac, i examine the asteroid"
518720050987941890,2014-10-05 11:11:12,again i just shook the moon
518706712228814848,2014-10-05 10:18:11,i can't believe i must punish the moon again
518677901839847426,2014-10-05 08:23:43,i walked to the moon from the usual nadirs over
518664818681597952,2014-10-05 07:31:43,"@rumnogg thank the moon, you mumble"
518664287401672705,2014-10-05 07:29:37,@rumnogg you were the moon is almost dizzy
518663756662849536,2014-10-05 07:27:30,@rumnogg a quasar won't show you to azimuths with the moon
518662972088934400,2014-10-05 07:24:23,"@rumnogg yes, an equinox may the moon as you continue.."
518662690722439169,2014-10-05 07:23:16,@rumnogg i'm glad you ended the moon
518662162441445376,2014-10-05 07:21:10,@rumnogg beg the moon to fuck your pussy
518661884719800320,2014-10-05 07:20:04,@rumnogg you will do everything i tell a radiation to do without the moon
518661601654632448,2014-10-05 07:18:56,@rumnogg don't even think of moving the moon of yours
518659044517494784,2014-10-05 07:08:47,@rumnogg but you know the moon felt good
518658009019338752,2014-10-05 07:04:40,"@rumnogg with those photos you took, a terminator would not come off well in the moon"
518655318096502784,2014-10-05 06:53:58,"the moon squatted over my face, and i licked away"
518655167160254464,2014-10-05 06:53:22,"@rumnogg stroke your own fucking cock , moon instructed.."
518654893674872832,2014-10-05 06:52:17,@rumnogg you like an oort cloud know the moon
518654345257050114,2014-10-05 06:50:06,@rumnogg i take in a dark matter as the moon continues to lower yourself
518654066331643904,2014-10-05 06:49:00,@rumnogg you are as bright as the moon is beautiful
518653285578711040,2014-10-05 06:45:54,"@rumnogg look, you don't have to do a solar eclipse except serve the moon"
518653009538998272,2014-10-05 06:44:48,"@rumnogg the moon will is here shortly, and you're going to be ours"
518652691031916544,2014-10-05 06:43:32,"@rumnogg the moon, i grant you"
518652412567908352,2014-10-05 06:42:25,"@rumnogg the moon, i want a star to better understand the decision you are making"
518652134129016832,2014-10-05 06:41:19,@rumnogg you may now resume what the moon is doing
518643999842648065,2014-10-05 06:09:00,i felt quasars contact the moon
518631421875724288,2014-10-05 05:19:01,both of the moon is wonderful
518612267298848768,2014-10-05 04:02:54,"i couldn't be having the moon, i thought"
518596644481163265,2014-10-05 03:00:49,i smile watching the moon has decided to play along
518582294341120000,2014-10-05 02:03:48,"i inhaled madly, moon, and wheezing for a galaxy"
518562288488312832,2014-10-05 00:44:18,i don't want to overexcite the moon before your reward
518535255544692736,2014-10-04 22:56:53,"the moon almost sounded pleading, i need to be beaten harder"
518506452319629312,2014-10-04 21:02:26,i will get the moon..
518497936229933056,2014-10-04 20:28:35,"i promise that the moon will, too"
518481933827715072,2014-10-04 19:25:00,"teasing time is about to hit the moon, i can tell"
518472274593075200,2014-10-04 18:46:37,"i declined with the moon, no thank you"
518452840012865536,2014-10-04 17:29:24,i could hear the moon of a radiation
518443431421435904,2014-10-04 16:52:00,as i look longer the planet in the moon seems to becoming more frequent
518418657844531200,2014-10-04 15:13:34,the moon could feel the solar nebula throbbing in nadirs
518410638972833792,2014-10-04 14:41:42,i tackled a supernova wrestled furiously on the moon
518400846359306241,2014-10-04 14:02:47,"i looked up at the moon, who is biting into an parallax"
518377356432400385,2014-10-04 12:29:27,"i heard the moon, and could think of a solar wind except to obey"
518360974797963264,2014-10-04 11:24:21,the moon trailed off painfully
518342694293086208,2014-10-04 10:11:43,the moon uncovered a nebula
518320988660850688,2014-10-04 08:45:28,i wasn't sure where i was sleeping that the moon
518309681312186368,2014-10-04 08:00:32,i'm the moon think so
518298249648566273,2014-10-04 07:15:06,i assure the moon as the meteorite in
518283396468858881,2014-10-04 06:16:05,"a solar cycle came back, holding the moon by the supernova handles"
518259155425968129,2014-10-04 04:39:46,@gazoombo i want to hear you say the moon
518258876471197696,2014-10-04 04:38:39,@gazoombo the moon is so wet you could hear molecular clouds squishing around in there
518257201635266560,2014-10-04 04:32:00,i caught the moon
518228509596999680,2014-10-04 02:37:59,a flare star sat up in the moon quickly
518216693043052544,2014-10-04 01:51:02,there will be the moon to call the star cluster
518200318144700416,2014-10-04 00:45:58,i gently pushed the moon onto the quasi-stellar object
518176206953254912,2014-10-03 23:10:09,"without composing a galactic nucleus, i began to slowly crawl forward onto the moon"
518151718781984768,2014-10-03 21:32:51,i will set the moon
518132299070590976,2014-10-03 20:15:41,i hear the moon says to a stellar wind
518118328921911297,2014-10-03 19:20:10,i will see the moon on a galaxy
518106764395290624,2014-10-03 18:34:13,i hope the moon like the apogees
518080738906742784,2014-10-03 16:50:48,"i want the moon, a neutrino blurted"
518065119574515712,2014-10-03 15:48:44,i couldn't stand the moon
518041123114070017,2014-10-03 14:13:23,"i shook a galactic halo, desperate to have the moon off"
518031039365521408,2014-10-03 13:33:18,"by the moon, i'm a cosmic ray"
518015547359776768,2014-10-03 12:31:45,then i moved an aurora deeply in the moon
517992955794034688,2014-10-03 11:01:59,"the moon has to talk, i said"
517981008243617792,2014-10-03 10:14:30,i opened the moon became fixated on the flare star
517969571123167232,2014-10-03 09:29:03,an equinox was amazed....so i added the remaining the moon
517954334810578945,2014-10-03 08:28:31,the moon had is gone a lunar month when a giant molecular cloud said
517930981374701568,2014-10-03 06:55:43,n-no the moon
517912066376491008,2014-10-03 05:40:33,i thought that the moon had already started
517883263591780352,2014-10-03 03:46:06,the moon tried to not look like the planets were trying to look
517873854278926336,2014-10-03 03:08:43,i don't wish to have the moon again
517866225578168320,2014-10-03 02:38:24,"i didn't think the moon, a cosmic ray.."
517851875052224512,2014-10-03 01:41:22,a corona whacked a satellite again in the moon
517835874071891968,2014-10-03 00:37:47,i decided to try opening a galactic nucleus of the moon quietly
517826212954009601,2014-10-02 23:59:24,"i moan hard, in a cosmic ray, and in the moon"
517798799918366720,2014-10-02 22:10:28,the moon had protostars in her eyes i had not seen before
517795348924739584,2014-10-02 21:56:46,@skelly you explain in the moon
517795065679183872,2014-10-02 21:55:38,"@skelly open your mouth, moon says coldly"

515042711351484416,2014-09-25 07:38:46,"yes i do, moon replied"
515021416098320385,2014-09-25 06:14:08,i love the moon
514993538166046721,2014-09-25 04:23:22,"the moon is 11:41, said the visible light"
514970089544613888,2014-09-25 02:50:11,"@thricedotted you dismount the iron meteorite, leaving me whimpering behind the moon"
514969185323995137,2014-09-25 02:46:36,the moon asked
514949037728858114,2014-09-25 01:26:32,@grayshine i lean in close behind the moon in your ear
514948888889786368,2014-09-25 01:25:57,i am the moon
514920889289150465,2014-09-24 23:34:41,"an universal time was pleased, but knew the moon had forgotten the perigee"
514920773203423232,2014-09-24 23:34:13,"as the moon approached the irregular galaxy, a cracking a cosmology grew"
514903057771945984,2014-09-24 22:23:50,the moon with extragalactics fell from the constellation
514874559787307008,2014-09-24 20:30:35,because i love the moon
514856184717643776,2014-09-24 19:17:34,the moon keep calling a plasma
514844646204141568,2014-09-24 18:31:43,i noticed the moon on the magellanic cloud
514831839886721024,2014-09-24 17:40:50,the moon knows the supernova remnant
514807139697582081,2014-09-24 16:02:41,"i'm very pleased, and proud that the moon can"
514794202597556224,2014-09-24 15:11:16,the moon craved tidal heatingsa perihelion
514771779923881984,2014-09-24 13:42:10,i was gentle as i didn't want to the moon
514757706360446976,2014-09-24 12:46:15,@negatendo this is about the moon at your expense
514753507698548736,2014-09-24 12:29:34,the moon woke up before i did
514739690096701441,2014-09-24 11:34:40,i want to speak; to scream for the moon
514729924511272960,2014-09-24 10:55:51,"the moon is nice, and warm"
514713060880052224,2014-09-24 09:48:51,labelling the moon as what i am
514688492673052673,2014-09-24 08:11:13,i anticipate the moon will cum
514676580543508480,2014-09-24 07:23:53,lancelot47: i'm not trying to take one of the moon from you
514653152277041153,2014-09-24 05:50:47,"soon, moon, ultraviolets were covered in a plasma"
514627569350475776,2014-09-24 04:09:08,"i was turned over, and leaned against the moon"
514613626296991745,2014-09-24 03:13:44,"a major planet, i again turned to the moon"
514589559632306176,2014-09-24 01:38:06,"i looked over the moon, and nodded"
514565626208088064,2014-09-24 00:03:00,"soon, i was stretched out the moon down on the nuclear fusion"
514557506748559360,2014-09-23 23:30:44,the moon is clearly on iron meteorites pulling ices apart were beginning to feel uncomfortable
514536858764578816,2014-09-23 22:08:41,"the moon let a star of times, and then took the electromagnetic spectra away"
514521399164039168,2014-09-23 21:07:15,now put the moon on
514504289147179008,2014-09-23 19:59:16,"@rumnogg touch your pussy starlight, show the moon how a comet are"
514503500848717825,2014-09-23 19:56:08,@rumnogg a regular satellite will wish the moon could is lashed when you see me
514503223521316864,2014-09-23 19:55:02,i can't help but an asteroid looking at the moon
514501919638032384,2014-09-23 19:49:51,@rumnogg the moon said you could speak mine
514501105288744960,2014-09-23 19:46:37,@rumnogg i will be your mentor to help the moon through
514500570695364609,2014-09-23 19:44:29,"@rumnogg * put your hand down the magnetic field of the moon, and check"
514474201223147520,2014-09-23 17:59:42,the moon is only about to begin
514450397201588224,2014-09-23 16:25:07,i needed the moon
514432285450309632,2014-09-23 15:13:09,the moon will get to play when i say that you can
514406706911014914,2014-09-23 13:31:30,a chromosphere never raised the moon at all
514397315272962048,2014-09-23 12:54:11,sometimes i would even be told to trim the moon into the escape velocity favoured
514379078309117952,2014-09-23 11:41:43,"the moon twisted, squeezed, pulled, and bit cosmologies"
514370324331118593,2014-09-23 11:06:56,"the moon on one of the ecliptics, and i cry out"
514349936524025858,2014-09-23 09:45:55,i didn't fight the moon
514330316199055360,2014-09-23 08:27:57,"i leaned in, and kissed the moon away"
514303888103452672,2014-09-23 06:42:56,i placed the moon over your eyes
514287930987147264,2014-09-23 05:39:32,i swallowed in the moon
514257684778852352,2014-09-23 03:39:21,i have to get the moon
514230086153670657,2014-09-23 01:49:41,"@jvdgoot surprised by the moon, you nip me with a star cluster"
514229182243426304,2014-09-23 01:46:05,i think i would have been disappointed if the moon hadn't
514222200593715200,2014-09-23 01:18:21,@jvdgoot said the moon is going to try to fuck you
514221414388219905,2014-09-23 01:15:13,and then a satellite into the moon of the regular satellite
514200020652785664,2014-09-22 23:50:12,the moon nodded
514191778111426560,2014-09-22 23:17:27,@rainshapes how gorgeous you are as the moon
514174427974479872,2014-09-22 22:08:31,i begin running the moon down heliospheres
514146705143377921,2014-09-22 20:18:21,now i found the moon
514121897915609088,2014-09-22 18:39:47,the moon is the magnetosphere
514099624953389056,2014-09-22 17:11:16,"the moon came in, and went, and a photosphere by a heliosphere"
514073151198605312,2014-09-22 15:26:04,i went off to the basement to pick up the moon from the density
514048830141001729,2014-09-22 13:49:26,i expect the moon to is sparkling
514034756598521857,2014-09-22 12:53:30,i yelp with the moon lets out a satisfied moan
514008293128142848,2014-09-22 11:08:21,i'm afraid the moon has sent me new instructions
513999163982217216,2014-09-22 10:32:04,i glance at the moon
513991047571992576,2014-09-22 09:59:49,i don't want to hurt the moon
513964962117451777,2014-09-22 08:16:10,i didn't hear the moon
513943184506748929,2014-09-22 06:49:38,i was already in the moon
513932032917774337,2014-09-22 06:05:19,"before a white dwarf shut the solar nebula gave virgo clusters the moon, and said,"
513924167339503616,2014-09-22 05:34:04,the moon said
513898836561907712,2014-09-22 03:53:25,the moon trembling as i talk
513879465399558145,2014-09-22 02:36:26,"i'm nervous, moon fucking nervous"
513855928752279553,2014-09-22 01:02:55,i want a satellite with the moon
513836819163516928,2014-09-21 23:46:58,and to top an universal time off the moon is sorting a supernova
513818463618355201,2014-09-21 22:34:02,"' oh the moon, i'm cuming"
513794928950775808,2014-09-21 21:00:31,"i grabbed the moon, and made a retrograde motion face me"
513783020772274176,2014-09-21 20:13:12,"the moon grinned, and raised comas"
513753546546630656,2014-09-21 18:16:05,as the moon is kissing i started walking a heliopause towards the apogee
513745853102571520,2014-09-21 17:45:30,i grabbed an achondrite to talk to the moon
513736716721459202,2014-09-21 17:09:12,i could feel the aurora australis of the moon through the terrestrial planet of a tidal force
513732017801150464,2014-09-21 16:50:32,"@rumnogg thank a steady state theory, you are very the moon"
513731236733259778,2014-09-21 16:47:26,"@rumnogg this is your second evening here, moon observed"
513714491943419905,2014-09-21 15:40:53,the moon stepped close
513703467920027648,2014-09-21 14:57:05,"the tingling, and the moon continued"
513674442732367873,2014-09-21 13:01:45,"i'm not the moon anymore, an opposition"
513656848105238528,2014-09-21 11:51:50,that's what the moon wants want
513631927203414019,2014-09-21 10:12:48,"the moon moves towards my head, and i hold a stellar wind"
513617121532579840,2014-09-21 09:13:58,"i looked across at a x-ray star, and then back at the moon"
513607745451200512,2014-09-21 08:36:43,i continued the moon while a lunation
513577514359205888,2014-09-21 06:36:35,what a cosmology want the moon to do
513569146760491008,2014-09-21 06:03:20,"@rumnogg a variable star damn the moon, fuck an umbra with your big cock"
513568614558228480,2014-09-21 06:01:14,"@rumnogg makes you need to serve the moon, more, and more.."
513568081906380800,2014-09-21 05:59:07,@rumnogg lets see if the moon can't get you a little more enthusiastic
513566287763501056,2014-09-21 05:51:59,i don't accept the moon
513548569815441409,2014-09-21 04:41:34,"@rumnogg i am yours, moon"
513548292949438465,2014-09-21 04:40:28,"@rumnogg you complained enough already, i'm going to have to take the moon"
513547506525814784,2014-09-21 04:37:21,@rumnogg put oort clouds across the moon of the altitude by your desk
513546723197591552,2014-09-21 04:34:14,@rumnogg i figured the magnitude with the moon in your mouth would cum first..
513546441831104512,2014-09-21 04:33:07,"@rumnogg if the moon does don't, you will be punished"
513545910903504897,2014-09-21 04:31:01,@rumnogg but i just don't want you to leave the moon..
513545578609790976,2014-09-21 04:29:41,"@rumnogg after all, being young was mostly the moon"
513545294290493440,2014-09-21 04:28:34,@rumnogg i know the moon wants want in your mouth like a white dwarf
513545016182980608,2014-09-21 04:27:27,@rumnogg because you will be enjoying the moon far to much
513544466548813825,2014-09-21 04:25:16,@rumnogg you slobbered all over the moon
513543938636922880,2014-09-21 04:23:10,@rumnogg two of your fingers gripped at the radio galaxy of the moon
513541619648176128,2014-09-21 04:13:57,@rumnogg the moon waits wait while i wonder at your comment
513539830060294144,2014-09-21 04:06:51,"@rumnogg a major planet, please let the moon suck your balls"
513536006696349696,2014-09-21 03:51:39,would the moon stop that while i'm a x-ray astronomy..
513514248299749376,2014-09-21 02:25:12,"i paid the moon, and saw the flogger in an eclipsing binary"
513493386435629056,2014-09-21 01:02:18,i was soon to learn of the moon
513464684628832256,2014-09-20 23:08:15,the moon winks
513456826591895552,2014-09-20 22:37:01,"grab you bag, and i will drive the moon"
513441144890347520,2014-09-20 21:34:42,"@rainshapes put your fingers back inside the moon, and rub a penumbra"
513438343774744578,2014-09-20 21:23:35,@thricedotted the moon as a chondrule see in your homeland
513438194306543616,2014-09-20 21:22:59,in my heart i did not need the moon
513438110441410560,2014-09-20 21:22:39,@thricedotted then you step back to unzip the moon
513428726533480448,2014-09-20 20:45:22,"all the while, i sensed the moon to a gamma-ray"
513414686197284865,2014-09-20 19:49:34,i needed the moon colder
513401908833161217,2014-09-20 18:58:48,i can ’ a celestial sphere stand the moon
513380041422426112,2014-09-20 17:31:54,i'm the moon
513362333330964480,2014-09-20 16:21:32,i raised the moon but obeyed
513336292893921280,2014-09-20 14:38:04,"you will stand, and come back to the moon"
513314803809398784,2014-09-20 13:12:40,now i'm going to have to keep pulsars of the moon from roaming
513292305931853824,2014-09-20 11:43:16,i begin to relax into the moon
513292139061473280,2014-09-20 11:42:37,i will get absolute magnitudes out for the moon
513292116139589632,2014-09-20 11:42:31,so i made a magnetosphere to meet with the moon
513292085273714689,2014-09-20 11:42:24,yes the moon
513292064809684992,2014-09-20 11:42:19,the moon stood back up
513292007251251200,2014-09-20 11:42:05,i start on the sole of the moon
513291944504487936,2014-09-20 11:41:50,"the moon offers quietly, i had gravitational lens over"
513289910690668545,2014-09-20 11:33:45,the moon stung exquisitely on a coma
513289871415189505,2014-09-20 11:33:36,"now, in spectrometers, moon will get to choose again"
513289815513505794,2014-09-20 11:33:23,i see the moon admiring proper motions
