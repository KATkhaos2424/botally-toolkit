521411719067738112,2014-10-12 21:26:55,"And only herald to the view,"
521396618805784577,2014-10-12 20:26:55,"I found, or thought I found, you never can be old,"
521373967337021440,2014-10-12 18:56:55,how I faint when I praise thee?
521358867318317056,2014-10-12 17:56:55,"Like as the marigold at the sun's eye,"
521351316602241024,2014-10-12 17:26:54,"In me thou see'st the twilight of such a beauteous day,"

521313563714285568,2014-10-12 14:56:53,That thou in him thy fair name.
521306013333340160,2014-10-12 14:26:53,Than that which is so strong
521290912165404672,2014-10-12 13:26:53,"And buds of May,"
521268260826673152,2014-10-12 11:56:52,"How far I count my gain,"

521192756761206784,2014-10-12 06:56:51,And in my verse shall stand.
521177655689748480,2014-10-12 05:56:50,"After my death,--dear love, happy to die!"
521155004627828738,2014-10-12 04:26:50,"I love not less, though they with winter meet,"

520852987690749952,2014-10-11 08:26:43,One of her pleasure!

520739732821524480,2014-10-11 00:56:41,Then if he can afford
520724631783624704,2014-10-10 23:56:41,My thoughts and my will one.
520717081780576256,2014-10-10 23:26:41,"Upon those blots that do with me remain,"

520649128208908288,2014-10-10 18:56:40,Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts can mend;
520634027284258816,2014-10-10 17:56:39,"And taught it this alchemy,"
520626476958228480,2014-10-10 17:26:39,Where all the better part of me?
520603826177314816,2014-10-10 15:56:39,Those that can see thou lov'st me for thee.
520596275272495104,2014-10-10 15:26:38,The living record of your liberty;
520588724980035584,2014-10-10 14:56:38,"Will sourly leave her face,"
520558523294306305,2014-10-10 12:56:38,"With beauty's treasure ere it be poison'd, 'tis true,'"

520513220855877632,2014-10-10 09:56:37,Yet nor the prophetic soul
520505670651482113,2014-10-10 09:26:37,I never saw that you should love
520498120472276992,2014-10-10 08:56:36,Or bends with the dust shall cover
520490569957523456,2014-10-10 08:26:36,"Nor his own vision holds what it works in, like the dyer's hand:"

520392413659926528,2014-10-10 01:56:34,Wherein it finds a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
520377312911441920,2014-10-10 00:56:34,A crow that flies in heaven's air:
520369761897570304,2014-10-10 00:26:33,Two loves I have seen the hungry ocean gain
520354660876447744,2014-10-09 23:26:33,"But is profan'd, if I should despair, I should your great deserts repay,"

520316908034224128,2014-10-09 20:56:32,Even that your love taught it thus anew to greet;
520309357733371904,2014-10-09 20:26:32,"To be death's conquest and make my love engrafted, to this hell."
520301806753046528,2014-10-09 19:56:32,"While thou dost breathe, or eyes can see!"
520294256888410112,2014-10-09 19:26:32,"The world will wail thee like a winter hath my heart and eyes have err'd,"
520286705828376576,2014-10-09 18:56:31,"Doth teach that ease and that smells,"
520279155296854016,2014-10-09 18:26:31,"Those hours, and times of pleasure,"
520271604668854272,2014-10-09 17:56:31,"But as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,"
520241402823733248,2014-10-09 15:56:30,"Are windows to my sightless view,"
520233852430610432,2014-10-09 15:26:30,Or who confounds him there;
520211200991195136,2014-10-09 13:56:30,Still constant in a kind of praise;
520203650195390464,2014-10-09 13:26:29,"And more, replete with you,"
520180998969909248,2014-10-09 11:56:29,You still the world enjoys it;

520165898024275968,2014-10-09 10:56:28,"Even that idle rank thoughts, my deeds must not be my gentle verse,"
520158348025405440,2014-10-09 10:26:28,"Within the knowledge of mine, to make thy large will more."
520135696565018624,2014-10-09 08:56:28,"Such civil war is as mine,"

520120595707490305,2014-10-09 07:56:28,"My grief lies buried,"
520113045238870016,2014-10-09 07:26:27,Of different flowers in odour and in my tongue
520090394516676608,2014-10-09 05:56:27,"But if it is, that I have look'd on truth"
520082843813179392,2014-10-09 05:26:27,"On Helen's cheek all art of beauty is, see where it lies,"

520067743052091392,2014-10-09 04:26:26,Give them thy fingers walk with gentle work did frame
520060193002893312,2014-10-09 03:56:26,And in my eye well knows the wide world's common place?
520037541760598016,2014-10-09 02:26:26,Such cherubins as your bounty doth appear;
520029991308775424,2014-10-09 01:56:26,And seal'd false Art what beauty was builded far from accident;
520022440861130752,2014-10-09 01:26:26,"The humble as the proudest sail doth it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers."
519999789488824320,2014-10-08 23:56:25,"So shall I say, mine eye is in my mind;"
519992239347355648,2014-10-08 23:26:25,"To mourn becoming of their woe,"
519984688568356865,2014-10-08 22:56:25,Who with his fear is to the other as your bounty doth appear;
519977138355593218,2014-10-08 22:26:25,"And grew a seeting bath, which is so vexed with watching and with tears?"
519962037246361601,2014-10-08 21:26:24,Nor think the place where he would be.
519916734443032576,2014-10-08 18:26:23,Let him but copy what in thee are all determinate.
519909183919882240,2014-10-08 17:56:23,"And summer's green all girded up in any chest,"
519878982783614976,2014-10-08 15:56:23,"Art left the prey of worms, my body is,"
519856331205779458,2014-10-08 14:26:22,"Like him that travels, I return rebuk'd to my gross body's treason;"
519848780762345472,2014-10-08 13:56:22,With insufficiency my dumb on high to sing
519841230335651841,2014-10-08 13:26:22,"No shape so true as all men's: no,"
519826129335488512,2014-10-08 12:26:21,"But you like none, none you, for love, that in your will,"
519803477757669377,2014-10-08 10:56:21,"And in my thought, whose love to you,"
519795927234527232,2014-10-08 10:26:21,Yet do our minutes hasten to raz'd oblivion yield his part
519788376308723712,2014-10-08 09:56:20,Nor praise the deep vermilion in the blazon of sweet silent thought
519773275480535041,2014-10-08 08:56:20,"Or whether doth my mind, when body's work's expired:"
519765725389815808,2014-10-08 08:26:20,"but with mine eyes,"
519758174753005568,2014-10-08 07:56:20,"And age in love, forget to say it is not so?"
519750624699625472,2014-10-08 07:26:20,"In sleep a king, but with divining eyes,"

519735523774959619,2014-10-08 06:26:19,"Upon the hours, that with gentle work did frame"
519727973591560192,2014-10-08 05:56:19,"And in mine own fears, nor the past,"
519720422921605120,2014-10-08 05:26:19,And place my merit in the mouths of men.
519697771427659776,2014-10-08 03:56:18,"In tender embassy of love, more blest may be the view;"
519667571218341888,2014-10-08 01:56:18,They look into the beauty of thy days.
519660019902468096,2014-10-08 01:26:18,But day doth daily draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
519614717732466688,2014-10-07 22:26:17,"Then, if thou thy self deceivest"
519599617218838528,2014-10-07 21:26:17,"And given to time thou grow'st,"
519576966161117184,2014-10-07 19:56:16,"Then others, for the breath that from my self depart"
519539214971441152,2014-10-07 17:26:16,Chiding that tongue that tells the story of thy jealousy?
519531664184070144,2014-10-07 16:56:15,"Speak of the spring, and I am blind."
519516563703996417,2014-10-07 15:56:15,"Or whether shall I say, mine eye is in my thought, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,"

516489067081392128,2014-09-29 07:26:04,That is his cheek the map of thine
516466415692312576,2014-09-29 05:56:03,"That thou in this line some interest,"
516458865475321856,2014-09-29 05:26:03,"Too base of thee defeated,"

516315409402707968,2014-09-28 19:56:00,"Theirs for their style I'll live in this poor rime,"
516307859122843648,2014-09-28 19:26:00,Hung with the time that face should form another;
516300309077831680,2014-09-28 18:56:00,"Like as, to brave him when he takes from you, I engraft you new."
516292758475001856,2014-09-28 18:26:00,"And lace itself with his fear is put beside his part,"
516277657793593344,2014-09-28 17:26:00,For no man ever lov'd.
516255006349991936,2014-09-28 15:55:59,And mock you look I death my days should expiate.
516239905693786112,2014-09-28 14:55:59,"Whose worth's unknown, although their eyes were kind,"
516232355212578817,2014-09-28 14:25:59,"how thy worth, what worth in you doth grow."
516224804844613633,2014-09-28 13:55:59,"That thou art true,"

516081348562268160,2014-09-28 04:25:56,That I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
516073798299181056,2014-09-28 03:55:56,This brand she quenched in a kind of meetness
516058697462595584,2014-09-28 02:55:56,"In me thou hast the strength of laws,"
516036046245462016,2014-09-28 01:25:55,"He of tall building, and he stole that word"
516028495911059457,2014-09-28 00:55:55,"And each, though my lover's life:"
516020945845100544,2014-09-28 00:25:55,"Without thy help, by all the better part of me?"
516013395410034688,2014-09-27 23:55:55,"Even of five hundred courses of the dead,"
515998294623780864,2014-09-27 22:55:54,"The ills that were not summer's distillation left,"

515922792399650816,2014-09-27 17:55:53,"Speak of my harmful deeds,"
515900141824249856,2014-09-27 16:25:53,"And in his thoughts of love as oft as mine,"
515892591674392576,2014-09-27 15:55:53,Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to thee.
515885041138671616,2014-09-27 15:25:53,If I lose through my unkind abuse.
515847290037100544,2014-09-27 12:55:52,"Look in thy beauty's field,"
515839739555897344,2014-09-27 12:25:52,"And each, though not so much as my poor name rehearse;"

515824638945816576,2014-09-27 11:25:52,For then despite of space I would not dull you with my life decay;
515809538788687872,2014-09-27 10:25:51,"Of faults conceal'd, wherein I see thee,"
515801988336857088,2014-09-27 09:55:51,All tongues--the voice of hate?
515786888125227008,2014-09-27 08:55:51,"Thou usurer, why dost thou abuse"
515771787645165568,2014-09-27 07:55:51,"And do not then say, a tyrant, have no leisure with my moan;"
515764237377892352,2014-09-27 07:25:51,"Cupid laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,"
515749137090768896,2014-09-27 06:25:51,"How many a thing I sought,"

515590582119325696,2014-09-26 19:55:48,And by a painted beauty to his store;
515583032535707648,2014-09-26 19:25:48,Hath dear religious love stol'n from thee.
515575481966411776,2014-09-26 18:55:48,Of thy fair name.
515567931858509824,2014-09-26 18:25:48,"Canst thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'"

515537731082928130,2014-09-26 16:25:47,"Than this rich praise,--that you alone, that thou dost common grow."
515530180769484800,2014-09-26 15:55:47,If thy sweet self dost give invention light?
515507529736933376,2014-09-26 14:25:47,But then begins a journey in my rhyme.
515499980052656128,2014-09-26 13:55:47,"Thou that art now the world's due, by the grave where buried love doth live,"
515492429533683712,2014-09-26 13:25:47,This I do not drop in for an after-loss:

515469778417246209,2014-09-26 11:55:46,That thy unkindness lays upon my brow;
515454677932982272,2014-09-26 10:55:46,"With insufficiency my heart, to die, I leave my love alone."
515447128206745603,2014-09-26 10:25:46,Who hateth thee that the world's false subtleties.
515432027588268032,2014-09-26 09:25:46,Love is subdu'd
515424477379698688,2014-09-26 08:55:46,"And there reigns Love, what now to register,"
515401827097903105,2014-09-26 07:25:45,"How would, I haste me to my bed,"
515394277006786560,2014-09-26 06:55:45,With thy sweet self dost deceive:
515386726613676034,2014-09-26 06:25:45,Both truth and beauty shall in my verse ever live young.
515364075631431682,2014-09-26 04:55:45,"To say, mine eye is my heart's guest,"
515348975562412032,2014-09-26 03:55:45,"As I, not show my head where thou mayst prove me."
515341424967954432,2014-09-26 03:25:44,"My reason, the pleasure of the fleeting year!"

515243271950315521,2014-09-25 20:55:43,Made more or less by thy beauty being false to me.
515228172179083264,2014-09-25 19:55:43,"So him I lose thee, my loss is my deserving?"
515220621899218944,2014-09-25 19:25:43,For that same groan doth put this in my head where thou mayst take
515197971588067328,2014-09-25 17:55:43,"Therefore like her, I am that I am, and they that level"
515190420859404288,2014-09-25 17:25:42,Compar'd with loss of thee this I prognosticate:
515182870726328320,2014-09-25 16:55:42,"The crow, or flowers with flowers gather'd."
515175320526131200,2014-09-25 16:25:42,"Might I not lock'd up in any chest,"
515152669711671297,2014-09-25 14:55:42,"I think good thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,"
515145119440183296,2014-09-25 14:25:42,"I cannot blame thee, thy record never can be miss'd."
515137569202257920,2014-09-25 13:55:41,"Past cure I am, and for true things deem'd."
515107368464445440,2014-09-25 11:55:41,"And yet thou mightst my seat forbear,"
515092267724337153,2014-09-25 10:55:41,How like a winter hath my added praise beside!
515084717800947712,2014-09-25 10:25:41,"He robs thee of, and for myself, no quiet find."
515069616914059264,2014-09-25 09:25:40,"In a cold valley-fountain of that fair thou ow'st,"
515054516492722176,2014-09-25 08:25:40,"I should be thy face,"
515024315482263552,2014-09-25 06:25:40,"When all my soul, and all my every part;"
515016765621809154,2014-09-25 05:55:40,"Intend a zealous pilgrimage to my true sight,"
515009215010570240,2014-09-25 05:25:39,"As any mother's child, though not so, I love thee in such sort,"
515001665124958209,2014-09-25 04:55:39,"Be anchor'd in the even,"
514994115046424576,2014-09-25 04:25:39,Then of thy worth and truth;
514986564280020992,2014-09-25 03:55:39,"And, thou away, art present still with them, and they with thee;"
514979014100803585,2014-09-25 03:25:39,"Haply I think on my defects,"
514971464466825217,2014-09-25 02:55:39,"Tan sacred beauty, and increase;"
514956363705769984,2014-09-25 01:55:39,By that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
514948813467832320,2014-09-25 01:25:39,"And that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'"
514933713331707904,2014-09-25 00:25:38,"The more I hear and see not what they see, know not the heart."
514918613111681024,2014-09-24 23:25:38,"Both find each other, and foison of the year,"
514911063347716096,2014-09-24 22:55:38,"To me, yet unset,"
514903512941998080,2014-09-24 22:25:38,"Take all my loves, my love still telling what is told."
514888412730372096,2014-09-24 21:25:38,"To kiss me, be it ill or well."
514873312933978112,2014-09-24 20:25:38,"From heaven the best,"
514865762691846144,2014-09-24 19:55:38,"When I have sworn deep oaths of thy hand,"
514843111852236801,2014-09-24 18:25:37,Thou art thy mother's glass and tell the day or night:
514835561903697921,2014-09-24 17:55:37,"No, it shapes them to your beauteous blessings add a curse,"
514828011724472320,2014-09-24 17:25:37,"He of tall building, and he stole that word"
514820461415251968,2014-09-24 16:55:37,"While shadows like to one more rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'"
514782709558689794,2014-09-24 14:25:36,Me for my dumb that cannot write to say
514767609015709696,2014-09-24 13:25:36,"No love, thou my love receivest,"
514760058891030528,2014-09-24 12:55:36,Who hast by day sunk in hideous night;
514752508527263744,2014-09-24 12:25:36,"Sland'ring creation with a backward look,"
514722307076399104,2014-09-24 10:25:35,"Robbing no old thing old, thou shalt not boast that I do betray"
514692106288254976,2014-09-24 08:25:35,"Why so large cost, having, and they, as pitying me,"
514677005569110017,2014-09-24 07:25:35,"A third, nor the prophetic soul"
514654355039850497,2014-09-24 05:55:34,"So true a fool is love, that in guess they measure by thy granting?"
514646804365713408,2014-09-24 05:25:34,"And look upon myself, but for thee will;"
514624153492541440,2014-09-24 03:55:34,"Whose speechless song being many, should do I question with my jealous thought"
514609053243170816,2014-09-24 02:55:33,"And in our lives a separable spite,"
514586402659397632,2014-09-24 01:25:33,"Who lead thee in such sort,"
514548652593786880,2014-09-23 22:55:33,"But do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how to make me love thee more,"
514533551929171968,2014-09-23 21:55:33,"Dost hold Time's fickle glass, and see not what they see?"
514526002060345344,2014-09-23 21:25:32,"Rise, resty Muse, and straight redeem,"
514503351686692864,2014-09-23 19:55:32,Full many a holy and obsequious tear
514495801939468289,2014-09-23 19:25:32,"To follow that which he doth say,"
514488251361796096,2014-09-23 18:55:32,"When others would give life, and shows not half your parts."
514465600836358144,2014-09-23 17:25:32,"Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not sinful then, and wish I were renew'd;"
514458050652958720,2014-09-23 16:55:32,"Thou blind fool, Love, and all her fading sweets;"
514420299647832064,2014-09-23 14:25:31,Exceeded by the grave and thee.
514405199662686208,2014-09-23 13:25:31,And for they looked but with thy self art so unprovident.
514397649567375361,2014-09-23 12:55:31,"Or call it winter meet,"
514390098788380673,2014-09-23 12:25:31,How like Eve's apple doth thy lays esteem
514374998236999680,2014-09-23 11:25:30,"But wherefore say not I that I do call my friend,"
514367447814533120,2014-09-23 10:55:30,They draw but what in thee doth live.
514352347426729984,2014-09-23 09:55:30,"You are my all-the-world, and this gives life to thee."
514344797385916416,2014-09-23 09:25:30,"Three beauteous springs to yellow leaves, by spirits taught to write,"
514314596555825153,2014-09-23 07:25:29,"Be wise as thou art why should I haste me to my bed,"
514307046783475712,2014-09-23 06:55:29,"Painting my age with beauty were bereft,"
514299496453263360,2014-09-23 06:25:29,Betwixt mine eye and heart are at a frown they in their garments though new-fangled ill;
514284396099010560,2014-09-23 05:25:29,"Thy love being crown'd with you,"
514269295853842433,2014-09-23 04:25:29,"That due to thee, but what in thee doth live."
514254195361189888,2014-09-23 03:25:29,"But as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,"
514223994132643840,2014-09-23 01:25:28,And in my heart.
514201343578230784,2014-09-22 23:55:28,"For such a scope to show her pride,"
514193793935884288,2014-09-22 23:25:28,That is so strong
514186243601465345,2014-09-22 22:55:28,"So, love to any,"
514148493200355328,2014-09-22 20:25:27,"And to be new made when thou art not, though I feel thou art,"
514133392858701824,2014-09-22 19:25:27,"For all above,"
514118292647071744,2014-09-22 18:25:27,Are both with thee shall stay.
514110742560141313,2014-09-22 17:55:27,"Or bends with the trophies of my self, all bare, is of more worth"
514088091603062784,2014-09-22 16:25:26,When that mine eye is my love that keeps mine eye awake:
514080541331554304,2014-09-22 15:55:26,"All this away, art present still with them, and they with thee;"
514065440918630400,2014-09-22 14:55:26,The which he toil'd:
514050340358868993,2014-09-22 13:55:26,"Of princes, shall outlive this powerful might,"
514042790146088961,2014-09-22 13:25:26,"My verse alone had all thy beauty tempting her to thee,"
514035239782326276,2014-09-22 12:55:26,"Each changing place with that Muse,"
513989938056937472,2014-09-22 09:55:25,"Sets you most rich in hope,"
513952187349606400,2014-09-22 07:25:24,"Thou art thy mother's glass and tell the day, to please him thou art bright,"
513937087284797440,2014-09-22 06:25:24,Some in their rotten smoke?
513921986544664577,2014-09-22 05:25:24,Tell me thou see'st the glowing of such triumph bars
513914435950227456,2014-09-22 04:55:24,"Cannot dispraise, but in a perpetual dulness."
513906885762633728,2014-09-22 04:25:24,"Which on thy sport,"
513891785584562176,2014-09-22 03:25:23,"Though you do write,"
513876685393911808,2014-09-22 02:25:23,Wherein it finds a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
513861584926437377,2014-09-22 01:25:23,"The worser spirit a woman woos, what now to register,"
513854034696888320,2014-09-22 00:55:23,"Who hast by waning grown, and in my way,"
513846484731572225,2014-09-22 00:25:23,"In me, fair friend, you never writ, nor the past,"
513838934996967426,2014-09-21 23:55:23,"Hath left me I bore the canopy,"
513816284362862592,2014-09-21 22:25:23,"Whereto all bonds of love control,"
513778534335016962,2014-09-21 19:55:22,"More flowers I noted, yet I have still the world well knows; yet none knows well"
513763433938837504,2014-09-21 18:55:22,"For if you read this line some interest,"
513748333626523650,2014-09-21 17:55:22,Who with his fear from thence:
513740783325696000,2014-09-21 17:25:22,"Which parts the shore, where is she so fair whose unear'd womb"
513718132628680705,2014-09-21 15:55:21,give thy self in single life?
513710582634008577,2014-09-21 15:25:21,"Who hast by waning grown, and me in that one 'Will.'"
513703032840663043,2014-09-21 14:55:21,"Or who his spoil of beauty set,"
513687932217987073,2014-09-21 13:55:21,"Hast thou, the master mistress of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake:"
513665281500016641,2014-09-21 12:25:21,"With April's first-born flowers, and purging fire"
513657731266273280,2014-09-21 11:55:21,"And made my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?"
513650180780867584,2014-09-21 11:25:20,Let him but copy what in thee are all determinate.
513642630874271744,2014-09-21 10:55:20,"Sland'ring creation with a backward look,"
513619979329998849,2014-09-21 09:25:20,"I will acquaintance strangle, and pays it thee again."
513612429343735808,2014-09-21 08:55:20,"To be diseas'd, ere thou be denied!"
513582227804798976,2014-09-21 06:55:19,Then thank him not from my love's breath?
513574677675905025,2014-09-21 06:25:19,"No, it for fear to wet a widow's eye,"
513536925005651968,2014-09-21 03:55:18,"Which by and by clean starved for a map doth Nature store,"
513521824714330112,2014-09-21 02:55:18,"The injuries that to thee did give,"
513461422433398784,2014-09-20 22:55:17,"For as you to me, then tender'd"
513438771946061824,2014-09-20 21:25:17,"So is, to decay;"
513423671696695297,2014-09-20 20:25:16,"But flowers distill'd, though rosy lips and cheeks"
513416121513291776,2014-09-20 19:55:16,"Such civil war shall statues overturn,"
513408571271151616,2014-09-20 19:25:16,"The soil is this, Time's pencil, beauty's truth to lay;"
513401021549129728,2014-09-20 18:55:16,"That is my home of love: if I should your great deserts repay,"
513385920981000194,2014-09-20 17:55:16,As with your most high deserts?
513363269889699841,2014-09-20 16:25:16,"Came there for cure and this by that which I compile,"
513355719341375488,2014-09-20 15:55:15,"Love's eye is in seeming trust,"
513333067868409857,2014-09-20 14:25:15,"When I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,"
513317966499160065,2014-09-20 13:25:14,"Thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,"
513287764662448128,2014-09-20 11:25:14,"The first my thought, whose million'd accidents"
513272663561629696,2014-09-20 10:25:13,"May still seem love to tell of good or evil luck,"
513234911226904576,2014-09-20 07:55:12,How sweet husband nature's riches from expense;
513219810193186816,2014-09-20 06:55:12,"For at a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?"
513212259632283648,2014-09-20 06:25:12,"Be scorn'd, like the ocean be"
513189608230617088,2014-09-20 04:55:11,"That due of many a thing I sought,"
513151856109842432,2014-09-20 02:25:11,Though not to love things nothing worth.
513136754413424641,2014-09-20 01:25:10,The more I hear and see not what they see aright?
513121653144829952,2014-09-20 00:25:10,These blenches gave my heart knows the wide world and all her fading sweets;
513114102625861633,2014-09-19 23:55:09,"Exceeded by the motion of thine, from these would I be gone,"
513099001617330177,2014-09-19 22:55:09,"The prey of worms, inheritors of this excess,"
513076350995812352,2014-09-19 21:25:09,No praise to thee my true spirit?
513053699501875200,2014-09-19 19:55:08,For how do I not free.
513038599235710976,2014-09-19 18:55:08,"Not wondering at the least, so long as brain and heart"
513008397810028544,2014-09-19 16:55:07,Give them thy fingers walk with gentle work did frame

512978196413685762,2014-09-19 14:55:07,Thou wilt restore to be assail'd;
512963095233171456,2014-09-19 13:55:06,"do not, if I no more can write!"
512947994128175104,2014-09-19 12:55:06,"Unlook'd, on better judgement making."
512940443089113088,2014-09-19 12:25:06,Finding thy worth gives thee all my poverty:

512895139065237504,2014-09-19 09:25:04,"Were it not with me remain,"
512880037444329472,2014-09-19 08:25:04,"Praising thy worth, what dark days seen!"
512872486635962369,2014-09-19 07:55:04,"But as the marigold at the present, doubting of the rest?"

510690358317965312,2014-09-13 07:24:04,"So shall be most my glory being extant, well might show"
510682807698333696,2014-09-13 06:54:04,I never saw that you should love
510675256722214912,2014-09-13 06:24:03,Since that my adder's sense
510652604716560386,2014-09-13 04:54:03,"Yet seem'd it winter, and increase;"
510645054138888192,2014-09-13 04:24:02,"Commit to these waste blanks, and thou are of one, hath every one, one shade,"
510622402447814656,2014-09-13 02:54:02,"More than enough am I as the rich, whose blessed key,"
510607301380562944,2014-09-13 01:54:01,"Giving him not enough to torture me alone,"
510592199981928449,2014-09-13 00:54:01,"And dumb presagers of my lameness, and I straight will halt,"
510577098897883136,2014-09-12 23:54:01,"His rider lov'd not speed, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,"
510561997885169664,2014-09-12 22:54:00,If the dull substance of my love no whit disdaineth;
510554447269732352,2014-09-12 22:24:00,"Be wise as thou fleets,"
510531795612229632,2014-09-12 20:53:59,But slave to mortal rage;
510516695010512896,2014-09-12 19:53:59,"Lest I, a tyrant, have often liv'd alone,"
510509144541900800,2014-09-12 19:23:59,That better state to me belongs to love's fine wit.
510486492876009472,2014-09-12 17:53:58,Or ten times happy me!
510471392190423041,2014-09-12 16:53:58,"Being fond on praise, thy tables, are within my brain"
510463841310752768,2014-09-12 16:23:58,"By chance, or thought I found, you never can be old,"
510448740184780801,2014-09-12 15:23:58,"And make me love thee more,"
510441189640646656,2014-09-12 14:53:57,"Which, used, lives upon his gains."
510426088380448768,2014-09-12 13:53:57,That for thy sake?
510410987459997696,2014-09-12 12:53:57,"But love, and look for recompense,"
510395886933786624,2014-09-12 11:53:56,"How sweet and lovely youth,"
510388336305778688,2014-09-12 11:23:56,In thee thy poet doth invent
510380785568739328,2014-09-12 10:53:56,Incapable of more worth
510373234944917504,2014-09-12 10:23:56,"Weighs not the power to hurt, and will do none,"
510327931097194496,2014-09-12 07:23:54,"That hath his adjunct pleasure,"
510305278781181952,2014-09-12 05:53:54,"Let me confess that thou bear'st love to constancy confin'd,"
510297727922479104,2014-09-12 05:23:53,If thou dost review
510290177160257536,2014-09-12 04:53:53,"And in my way,"
510282626884587520,2014-09-12 04:23:53,"from what power hast thou this becoming of their woe,"
510259974753103872,2014-09-12 02:53:52,The summer's flower is to render thee.
510244873828462592,2014-09-12 01:53:52,"Nay, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,"
510229772153012224,2014-09-12 00:53:51,"With what I think on thee, dear friend, and I assure ye,"
510214670834073600,2014-09-11 23:53:51,"And yet, love knows it is but one, and me in that one 'Will.'"
510207120189304833,2014-09-11 23:23:51,"The lovely gaze where every eye doth feast,"
510199569645195264,2014-09-11 22:53:51,"As if by every pen,"
510176918067740672,2014-09-11 21:23:50,"To-morrow see again, and times of brass are spent."
510169366826999809,2014-09-11 20:53:50,"He lends thee virtue, and increase;"
510161816396128256,2014-09-11 20:23:50,"Which should example where your true love may seem false in this shalt find thy monument,"
510131613661818881,2014-09-11 18:23:49,"Where time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,"
510116512233844736,2014-09-11 17:23:48,"Nor my sick Muse doth my mind, being crown'd with you,"
510108961786187776,2014-09-11 16:53:48,Whoever hath shown.
510093860907651072,2014-09-11 15:53:48,"let me suffer, being best acquainted,"
510086310074146817,2014-09-11 15:23:47,"none but in her poor rime,"
510078759429361664,2014-09-11 14:53:47,"To let base clouds o'ertake me in my love and pity doth the impression fill,"
510071208956538880,2014-09-11 14:23:47,"Although thou steal thy sweet that smells,"
510056107763437568,2014-09-11 13:23:47,"Gentle thou art belov'd of many,"
510033456374366208,2014-09-11 11:53:46,And though they with thee;
510025905574400000,2014-09-11 11:23:46,"For fear of trust, forget to say it is best painter's art."
510018355042865152,2014-09-11 10:53:46,"I think good thoughts, although to-day thou fill"
510003254130778113,2014-09-11 09:53:45,"Yet so they mourn becoming of things past,"
509995703817338880,2014-09-11 09:23:45,"Profitless usurer, why dost thou dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:"
509988153378091009,2014-09-11 08:53:45,"And grew a seeting bath, which wit so poor as mine"
509973051564257280,2014-09-11 07:53:44,"When most impeach'd, stands least in thy breast doth live, now Nature bankrupt is,"
509957950027227136,2014-09-11 06:53:44,"Whilst he upon your dearest love to you,"
509935298076106752,2014-09-11 05:23:43,"Unless thou take that honour from thy brain,"
509927747053817856,2014-09-11 04:53:43,"And yet it may be said I could write the beauty of your eyes,"
509905095404687360,2014-09-11 03:23:42,"All this away, the very birds are mute:"
509897544311128064,2014-09-11 02:53:42,And all my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
509889993922183169,2014-09-11 02:23:42,To weigh how once in the main of blood and fill'd his brow
509882442967027712,2014-09-11 01:53:42,Could make me tongue-tied speaking of your fair eyes
509859791531802624,2014-09-11 00:23:41,Devouring Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
509852240975114240,2014-09-10 23:53:41,For that which still doth grow?
509844690439385089,2014-09-10 23:23:41,"And many maiden gardens, yet canst not live?"
509837140075622401,2014-09-10 22:53:41,"Of princes, nor the sweet smell"
509822038974799872,2014-09-10 21:53:40,"In days long since cancell'd woe,"
509814488262930432,2014-09-10 21:23:40,Mine eye hath shown.
509806937752354816,2014-09-10 20:53:40,"Use power with power, and slay me not with thine eye aside:"
509769184192888832,2014-09-10 18:23:39,"That then love, though they with winter meet,"
509761633887862784,2014-09-10 17:53:39,"Like as, to make one twain,"
509754083024986112,2014-09-10 17:23:38,"Till my bad, my love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,"
509738982440067072,2014-09-10 16:23:38,"And keep invention in a cool well by,"
509731431845593088,2014-09-10 15:53:38,"Although in me each part will be the tomb,"
509716330694455297,2014-09-10 14:53:37,"And precious phrase by all above,"
509663476449439744,2014-09-10 11:23:36,And all mine eye hath shown.
509648375319252993,2014-09-10 10:23:36,"To show false Art what beauty is suspect,"
509633273970970624,2014-09-10 09:23:35,What merit lived in me can nothing worthy prove;
509618172807229440,2014-09-10 08:23:35,"That's for thy hand,"
509610622363770880,2014-09-10 07:53:35,When I perceive that loss;
509603072075505665,2014-09-10 07:23:35,"Which, like him with friends possess'd,"
509595521636241408,2014-09-10 06:53:34,"For through the cloud thou break,"
509565319447203841,2014-09-10 04:53:34,To this I prognosticate:
509557769091817472,2014-09-10 04:23:33,For blunting the fine wit.
509550218317008896,2014-09-10 03:53:33,And made my self a motley to the time that face should form another;
509542667856797696,2014-09-10 03:23:33,In one of your frame;
509535117325262848,2014-09-10 02:53:33,"The charter of thy beauty do I journey on the way,"
509527567217356801,2014-09-10 02:23:33,Even that your trespass now becomes a fee;
509520016312516608,2014-09-10 01:53:32,And perspective it is abus'd.
509512465609019392,2014-09-10 01:23:32,But then my eye doth view
509497364617252864,2014-09-10 00:23:32,"Like as, to make thy large will more."
509489814253469696,2014-09-09 23:53:32,"Then happy I, that which I then did feel,"
509474713060401152,2014-09-09 22:53:31,"While shadows like to one more rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'"
509459611686940672,2014-09-09 21:53:31,This I do vow and this by that I have seen the hungry ocean gain
509436960130093057,2014-09-09 20:23:30,"When not to tell of good or evil luck,"
509429409141379072,2014-09-09 19:53:30,But when I saw myself to win!
509421858681155584,2014-09-09 19:23:30,So long as brain and heart are at a frown they in their glory die.
509414307969249280,2014-09-09 18:53:30,"Make thee another self for love of you,"
509406757815201793,2014-09-09 18:23:30,The world will wail thee are all determinate.
509384106124120064,2014-09-09 16:53:29,"So I, whilst thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse in time to come,"
509376556053970944,2014-09-09 16:23:29,"Unthrifty loveliness, and foison of the time removed was summer's time;"
509361455234174976,2014-09-09 15:23:29,To show false plague are they now transferr'd.
509346354917679104,2014-09-09 14:23:28,"More worthy I to none alive,"
509338803983511552,2014-09-09 13:53:28,And live no hatred in thine or thee.
509316152552484864,2014-09-09 12:23:28,"To make me any summer's story tell,"
509301051699113984,2014-09-09 11:23:27,"On whom frown'st thou that I am shamed by that which I bring forth,"
509278400175812609,2014-09-09 09:53:27,In our two loves there is no need.
509255748623159296,2014-09-09 08:23:26,"And with thy self alone,"
509248198011924480,2014-09-09 07:53:26,She keeps thee to a summer's day?
509233096726552577,2014-09-09 06:53:26,"Music to hear her speak, what now to register,"
509225545855291393,2014-09-09 06:23:25,"Thy face hath no exchequer now but his,"
509210444884480001,2014-09-09 05:23:25,In one of your fair eyes
509195342995128320,2014-09-09 04:23:24,To critic and to temptation slow;
509157589779615744,2014-09-09 01:53:23,"Is writ do lie,"
509150038937698304,2014-09-09 01:23:23,"But all alone beweep my outcast state,"
509142488175493120,2014-09-09 00:53:23,Not that receive thee more:
509127386940461056,2014-09-08 23:53:22,As easy might I not glance aside
509082082492944384,2014-09-08 20:53:21,"Thy looks should nothing thence, but thinking on thy humour doth depend:"
509066981044006912,2014-09-08 19:53:20,Let those whom nature hath not the power to make love groan;
509059430449557504,2014-09-08 19:23:20,"That love is as a fever longing still,"
509036778502639616,2014-09-08 17:53:20,"Mad in pursuit and in their birth, some in their skill,"
509029227874639872,2014-09-08 17:23:19,"When you to my thoughts as food to breed another thee,"
509006575931904000,2014-09-08 15:53:19,"Nor that flower with base infection meet,"
508983923481669632,2014-09-08 14:23:18,"By that sweet odour, which doth in it thou art my all."
508961271350177792,2014-09-08 12:53:17,For I have sworn thee fair; more for me than you your self here live:
508931069169500161,2014-09-08 10:53:17,If I could not so bright
508923518373724160,2014-09-08 10:23:16,"Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou abuse"
508908417293897729,2014-09-08 09:23:16,"Which to my breast, where-through the sun"
508900866598764544,2014-09-08 08:53:16,"My sweet love's beauty, though alter'd new;"
508863112976416768,2014-09-08 06:23:15,Do I not spend
508855562373578752,2014-09-08 05:53:14,"Both find each other, and this with thee remains."
508817809481035776,2014-09-08 03:23:13,"One will of mine, mine is slain,"
508810258785902592,2014-09-08 02:53:13,"When sometime lofty towers I see barren of new pride,"
508802708145315840,2014-09-08 02:23:13,"Drawn after you, as you to my thoughts as food to life,"
508757404553469952,2014-09-07 23:23:12,"Was, sleeping, by spirits taught to write,"
508727201848508416,2014-09-07 21:23:11,"Who plead for love, hate on, for now I know it not."
508719651266629632,2014-09-07 20:53:11,"No, it shapes them to your feature."
508712100533776384,2014-09-07 20:23:10,"O'er whom thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss."
508696999374249985,2014-09-07 19:23:10,"Be thou the tenth Muse, my love's sweet face survey,"
508674346953363456,2014-09-07 17:53:09,"Dulling my lines, and no sooner but despised straight;"
508659245420531712,2014-09-07 16:53:09,"never say that thee behold,"
508651694842863616,2014-09-07 16:23:09,"Weary with toil, the very birds are mute:"
508644144382627840,2014-09-07 15:53:08,"Give my love, to thee I so belong,"
508629043252432896,2014-09-07 14:53:08,"If it were happier than thou art,"
508606390743465985,2014-09-07 13:23:07,"Be wise as thou wilt look,"
508598839977050112,2014-09-07 12:53:07,"In my love's picture then my eye doth feast,"
508576188143374336,2014-09-07 11:23:06,"Thus is his gold complexion dimm'd,"
508568637569908736,2014-09-07 10:53:06,To change your day of youth in every blessed shape we know.
508545985769783297,2014-09-07 09:23:05,"Now with the time exchang'd,"
508538435359891457,2014-09-07 08:53:05,Coral is far more pleasing sound:
508530884878675968,2014-09-07 08:23:05,Love is too young to know what beauty was of yore.
508515783173877760,2014-09-07 07:23:05,"So should that harvest reap,"
508508232482967553,2014-09-07 06:53:04,"A loss in love, you know,"
508500681603284992,2014-09-07 06:23:04,"Which bounteous gift thou shouldst depart,"
508455377185153025,2014-09-07 03:23:03,"And my plague thus far I behold the violet past prime,"
508447826980765696,2014-09-07 02:53:03,"Which this, and all Love's loving parts,"
508440275593621504,2014-09-07 02:23:02,And by and by black night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.
508432724978188288,2014-09-07 01:53:02,"Till Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,"
508417624145797120,2014-09-07 00:53:02,That barren tender of a throned queen
508410073391960065,2014-09-07 00:23:01,"And more, replete with too much rage,"
508402522826895360,2014-09-06 23:53:01,Mad in pursuit and in my rhyme.
508394972412801025,2014-09-06 23:23:01,That thou art my all.
508387421482807296,2014-09-06 22:53:01,"So do our lives a separable spite,"
508379870951268352,2014-09-06 22:23:01,"If thy soul check thee that I do call my friend,"
508364769229688832,2014-09-06 21:23:00,"I see a better spirit doth use your name,"
508349667533279232,2014-09-06 20:23:00,"That you are, how happy you make those."
508334565807489024,2014-09-06 19:22:59,"If any, be kind;"
508327014957211648,2014-09-06 18:52:59,"Which erst from heat, recounting it to me:"
508319464266280960,2014-09-06 18:22:59,Vaunt in their badness reign.
508304362087530496,2014-09-06 17:22:58,Yet this shall ever be;
508281709419188224,2014-09-06 15:52:57,"For then my eye doth feast,"
508274158858293248,2014-09-06 15:22:57,For nothing this wide world will be thy widow well may keep
508251506466762753,2014-09-06 13:52:56,As those whose unear'd womb wherein they grew?
508221304630034432,2014-09-06 11:52:55,When thou thy sins enclose.
508206203462115328,2014-09-06 10:52:55,Whose action is no need.
508183551414513664,2014-09-06 09:22:54,Therefore in my will no fair acceptance shine?
508176000673259520,2014-09-06 08:52:54,"That thou art old,"
508160899522101248,2014-09-06 07:52:54,"Be absent from thy brain,"
508153348608897024,2014-09-06 07:22:54,"So dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,"
508145798178013184,2014-09-06 06:52:53,"Who hast by waning grown, and frowns, and wrinkles strange."
508138247843614720,2014-09-06 06:22:53,"No, neither he, nor red nor white, why then her breasts are dun;"
508130697173667841,2014-09-06 05:52:53,"then she lies,"
508123146596020224,2014-09-06 05:22:53,"Holds in perfection but a common grave,"
508115595716345856,2014-09-06 04:52:53,This wish I were renew'd;
508108045046407168,2014-09-06 04:22:52,"Then if he thrive and I assure ye,"
508077841573883904,2014-09-06 02:22:51,"Or mine eyes, seeing this, would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made"
508070290929102848,2014-09-06 01:52:51,"Kill me outright with looks, the false heart's history"
508062740074602496,2014-09-06 01:22:51,"If my dear love were but sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee."
508047638558564352,2014-09-06 00:22:50,And for they looked but with thy tongue:
508040088098312192,2014-09-05 23:52:50,Past reason hunted; and no pace perceiv'd;
508024987081388032,2014-09-05 22:52:50,"Yet fear her, because thou know'st I am forsworn,"
508017435979444224,2014-09-05 22:22:49,"From limits far remote, drawn by mutual ordering;"
508002334878617600,2014-09-05 21:22:49,"And see thy blood warm when thou wilt; for I, being pent in walls of glass,"
507994784049291264,2014-09-05 20:52:49,As those two mourning doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.
507987233308028928,2014-09-05 20:22:49,"Or call it winter still, and you away,"
507972131410309120,2014-09-05 19:22:48,"But thou art covetous, and he is kind;"
507957030242369536,2014-09-05 18:22:48,Methinks no face she turns my silence cannot boast;
507949479018770432,2014-09-05 17:52:47,"That for thy right, thy inward love of me,"
507934377288814592,2014-09-05 16:52:47,"And night doth take away,"
507926826220404736,2014-09-05 16:22:46,To mourn becoming of thine eyes?
507919275479158784,2014-09-05 15:52:46,"Our dates are brief, and true, no truth of such account;"
507904173635940352,2014-09-05 14:52:46,That in the very worst of fortune's might;
507896622831783936,2014-09-05 14:22:45,Then hate me when I praise thee?
507866419904532480,2014-09-05 12:22:44,That in the eyes of all posterity
507851318665310208,2014-09-05 11:22:44,"His rider lov'd not speed, being made of four, with weary car,"
507836217015029760,2014-09-05 10:22:43,May time disgrace and wretched errors note;
507790912231968768,2014-09-05 07:22:42,"Enjoy'd no sooner had,"
507783361511706624,2014-09-05 06:52:42,By self-example mayst thou taste.
507775811106009088,2014-09-05 06:22:42,"Even as when first I saw you fresh, which yet are green."
507753158693502976,2014-09-05 04:52:41,"If it, and rude, barrenly perish:"
507745608182923264,2014-09-05 04:22:41,Not once vouchsafe to hide my will one.
507738057701732353,2014-09-05 03:52:40,Who even but now come back again is swerving.
507707854795444224,2014-09-05 01:52:40,"And each day say o'er the level of your frown,"
507654999250178048,2014-09-04 22:22:38,"Sometime all full with wills, and shows not half your parts."
507647448592822272,2014-09-04 21:52:38,"Then, if for my love, that made me first your slave,"
507639898178723842,2014-09-04 21:22:37,"Which should that my name receives a brand,"
507632346988679168,2014-09-04 20:52:37,"Whoe'er keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill"
507624796356489216,2014-09-04 20:22:37,I do believe her though I mistake my view;
507609694903353346,2014-09-04 19:22:36,The worser spirit a woman wert thou first created;
507571941088055299,2014-09-04 16:52:35,"So great a sum of sums, yet, love to hear her speak, yet well I know thy mind,;"
507564390300667905,2014-09-04 16:22:35,"And each doth good turns eyes for eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine image dies with thee."
507541737447776258,2014-09-04 14:52:34,"My tongue-tied patience with too much profane, should do thee shame,"
507488881738932224,2014-09-04 11:22:32,Mine own true love call;
507473780705198080,2014-09-04 10:22:32,"And age in love, but truly write,"
507466230328864768,2014-09-04 09:52:32,Resembling strong youth in every blessed shape we know.
507458679411470336,2014-09-04 09:22:31,So thou be distill'd:
507443578918805504,2014-09-04 08:22:31,"For I have scanted all,"
507436027745533952,2014-09-04 07:52:31,The manner of my faults thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!
507405824906371072,2014-09-04 05:52:30,"To shun the heaven that leads men to this purpose, that her skill"
507398274148335616,2014-09-04 05:22:30,That am debarre'd the benefit of ill!
507360520211415040,2014-09-04 02:52:28,"Whate'er thy thoughts, more blest may be the view;"
507352969470177280,2014-09-04 02:22:28,Which many legions of true minds
507322766924603393,2014-09-04 00:22:27,"And darkly bright, are sweetest odours made:"
507315215982010368,2014-09-03 23:52:27,"In loving thee thou know'st I love is better than mine own desert,"
507307665391747072,2014-09-03 23:22:27,"Since that my life, saying 'not you'."
507292563615662080,2014-09-03 22:22:26,"To that sweet odour, which now seem woe,"
507285012870213632,2014-09-03 21:52:26,"Or made them swear against the cold,"
507254809842307073,2014-09-03 19:52:25,"But now is thine, and born of love?"
507247259176534016,2014-09-03 19:22:25,"Which, used, lives upon his gains."
507239708540145664,2014-09-03 18:52:25,"Look in thy glass and tell the day, to bear that weight in me,"
507224607586148352,2014-09-03 17:52:24,Thine by thy deeds;
507209508066582528,2014-09-03 16:52:24,"What can mine own desert,"
507194406349205504,2014-09-03 15:52:24,But things remov'd that hidden in thee a thousand errors note;
507179306007535616,2014-09-03 14:52:24,"But since mourning doth thee grace,"
507134003996942336,2014-09-03 11:52:23,"But thou wilt look,"
507126452936900611,2014-09-03 11:22:22,"And Time that gave sweet leave,"
507118902485061632,2014-09-03 10:52:22,"My grief lies onward, and he is kind;"
507103800922873856,2014-09-03 09:52:22,"For having traffic with thy much clearer light,"
507088699696234496,2014-09-03 08:52:21,"Though to itself, it shapes them to your feature."
507073598322769921,2014-09-03 07:52:21,"Thy face hath not figur'd to thee did give,"
507058496810921985,2014-09-03 06:52:20,"How like a winter hath my pen,--"
507050946346504192,2014-09-03 06:22:20,"He pays the whole, and yet I know thy change."
507043395768815617,2014-09-03 05:52:20,And found it in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
507035844935299073,2014-09-03 05:22:20,"Who even but now come back again, and straight redeem,"
507005641794154496,2014-09-03 03:22:19,Who all their parts of thee that the thought of hearts can mend;
506998090981576704,2014-09-03 02:52:19,"No praise to thee my true love control,"
506982989561991168,2014-09-03 01:52:18,"Hate of my sin, by evil luck,"
506960337212432384,2014-09-03 00:22:17,That in the world's false subtleties.
506945236023517184,2014-09-02 23:22:17,Most true concord of thy sight;
506937685735272448,2014-09-02 22:52:17,But in them all;
506907482652827648,2014-09-02 20:52:16,"All this away, art present still with thee partake?"
506899931919941632,2014-09-02 20:22:16,In things turns to fair that eyes can see!
506892380859932672,2014-09-02 19:52:15,"Thy glass will show thee how to make our appetite more keen,"
506884830227730432,2014-09-02 19:22:15,"Do I not think on thee,-- and then my eye doth feast,"
506877279473897472,2014-09-02 18:52:15,what an unthrift in the eyes of all posterity
506869728556482560,2014-09-02 18:22:15,"The ills that were not summer's distillation left,"
506847076970287104,2014-09-02 16:52:14,When day's oppression is not so much as my poor name rehearse;
506839526942048256,2014-09-02 16:22:14,This wish I were renew'd;
506809327395405825,2014-09-02 14:22:14,"Better becomes the grey cheeks of the thing it was,"
506786674752225280,2014-09-02 12:52:13,"Come daily to the time, if ever that time come,"
506764022578823168,2014-09-02 11:22:12,"If thy soul knows, is of my wailing chief,"
506733821056667648,2014-09-02 09:22:12,"if thou wouldst use the strength of laws,"
506718717711884289,2014-09-02 08:22:11,"It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor I to none alive,"
506696066570268672,2014-09-02 06:52:10,"So, till you require."
506680964894818304,2014-09-02 05:52:10,"But if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,"
506665862971928576,2014-09-02 04:52:09,"Vaunt in their hawks and hounds, some wantonness;"
506658312616546304,2014-09-02 04:22:09,"Thus far for love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--"
506643211012427776,2014-09-02 03:22:09,"Love is too young to know what beauty is suspect,"
506635659998527488,2014-09-02 02:52:08,"Comes home again, and do not kill"
506620558146953216,2014-09-02 01:52:08,"Then the conceit of shame, ever the same,"
506582804482646017,2014-09-01 23:22:07,And play the watchman ever for thy sake:
506567703021121536,2014-09-01 22:22:06,"That looks on tempests and is partly blind,"
506552601320505344,2014-09-01 21:22:06,"The worst was this,--my love was new, but that which is"
506545050713477120,2014-09-01 20:52:05,"So thou through windows of thine, from that which thou departest;"
506537499867357184,2014-09-01 20:22:05,"Because I would be forgot,"
506522398544257024,2014-09-01 19:22:05,Say that thou none lov'st is most evident:
506514847689756673,2014-09-01 18:52:04,From this the world well knows; yet none knows well
506507297850277888,2014-09-01 18:22:04,"With my love's picture in black ink my love may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:"
506484647484616704,2014-09-01 16:52:04,"He learn'd but surety-like to be a devil,"
506477097389273088,2014-09-01 16:22:04,Wherein it finds a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
506469546291507201,2014-09-01 15:52:04,"Am of my self, that putt'st forth all to use,"
506454445824036864,2014-09-01 14:52:04,"That may express my love, be thou, although to-day thou fill"
506439346002464768,2014-09-01 13:52:03,But things remov'd that hidden in thee are all determinate.
506431796444008448,2014-09-01 13:22:03,Not from the stars in them I read such art
506409142999728128,2014-09-01 11:52:02,what a happy title do I not spend
506371391789101056,2014-09-01 09:22:02,"Cupid laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,"
506356290105257985,2014-09-01 08:22:01,"Is it for fear of trust, forget to say it is, that I have look'd on truth"
506348739280113665,2014-09-01 07:52:01,"Have put on just proof surmise, accumulate;"
506333637575319552,2014-09-01 06:52:01,"But reckoning Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,"
506326086683070464,2014-09-01 06:22:00,"Where breath most breathes, and I assure ye,"
506303433897283584,2014-09-01 04:51:59,"So dost thou to mine eyes,"
506288332582555650,2014-09-01 03:51:59,Thou art the grave and thee.
506265680597893120,2014-09-01 02:21:58,Will play the tyrants to the very refuse of thy deeds
506258130842288128,2014-09-01 01:51:58,"That time of beauty set,"

505941000791945216,2014-08-31 04:51:49,Which proves thievish progress to eternity.
505933449891287040,2014-08-31 04:21:48,Therefore to give back again.
505918348610117632,2014-08-31 03:21:48,And for myself to win!

505253883606618112,2014-08-29 07:21:27,That barren tender of a former child!

504951851557470208,2014-08-28 11:21:17,Supposed as forfeit to a summer's day?
504944300677804032,2014-08-28 10:51:17,Do not so great:
504914098136436736,2014-08-28 08:51:16,Straight in her blood;

504204333764726784,2014-08-26 09:50:55,On whom frown'st thou that which longer nurseth the disease;
504196782801166336,2014-08-26 09:20:55,"Which time mine eye is my heart's right, thy inward love of heart."
504189231976046592,2014-08-26 08:50:54,And therefore to be assail'd;

504174130669694976,2014-08-26 07:50:54,Sweets with these did play.
504159028964904961,2014-08-26 06:50:54,"As victors of my harmful deeds,"
504151478106222592,2014-08-26 06:20:53,And the fairest and most precious jewel.
504143927352389633,2014-08-26 05:50:53,Thy face hath not figur'd to thee my best of love.
504136377013772288,2014-08-26 05:20:53,For they in their rotten smoke?

504060869001478145,2014-08-26 00:20:50,"That hath his adjunct pleasure,"
504045767976550400,2014-08-25 23:20:50,"Look in your glass, his for his scythe to mow:"
504030665956798465,2014-08-25 22:20:49,Chiding that tongue that tells the story of thy budding name!
504015564960849921,2014-08-25 21:20:49,"In whose confine immured is the time exchang'd,"
504008014362193920,2014-08-25 20:50:49,"For that deep wound it gives my friend for my sake even so doth she abuse me,"
503992912934232064,2014-08-25 19:50:48,Look in your decay
503970260471386113,2014-08-25 18:20:48,But day they view in praise devise.
503947608235053056,2014-08-25 16:50:47,I see descriptions of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.
503932506874183681,2014-08-25 15:50:46,"Use power with power, and yet am I that vex'd thee still,"
503917405391704065,2014-08-25 14:50:46,"But since, before these last so bad."
503909854734344193,2014-08-25 14:20:46,"Who, moving others, for the breath of words respect,"
503902303972106241,2014-08-25 13:50:45,"All men make faults, and see not what they see?"
503894753092448256,2014-08-25 13:20:45,"But as the rich, whose million'd accidents"
503887202493808640,2014-08-25 12:50:45,"Was, sleeping, by the grave and thee."
503879651953889280,2014-08-25 12:20:45,"And therefore from my love's sweet face survey,"
503864550395879424,2014-08-25 11:20:44,And in my head where thou art why should I haste me thence?
503841898172129280,2014-08-25 09:50:44,"Just to the time, not in smiling pomp, nor falls"
503834347447672832,2014-08-25 09:20:43,"But if the while I think on thee,-- and then my thoughts--from far where I abide--"
503819245814181888,2014-08-25 08:20:43,"What's new to speak, yet well I know it not."
503811694838030337,2014-08-25 07:50:43,To find out shames and praises be
503781492347006976,2014-08-25 05:50:42,"That I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,"
503758840681091072,2014-08-25 04:20:41,But when in thee time's furrows I have seen the hungry ocean be
503721087335530496,2014-08-25 01:50:40,Who art the time-bettering days.
503713536514592769,2014-08-25 01:20:40,Then better'd that the thought of hearts can mend;
503698435510243328,2014-08-25 00:20:39,Which like two spirits do not kill
503683334312955905,2014-08-24 23:20:39,And threescore year would make the taker mad:
503675783869501440,2014-08-24 22:50:39,From whence at pleasure thou mayst in me behold
503660683351687168,2014-08-24 21:50:39,"Desiring this man's art, and of goodly pride:"
503653132992126976,2014-08-24 21:20:38,"Nor gives my friend, and I assure ye,"
503638032017149952,2014-08-24 20:20:38,Since my brain and heart
503600279455952897,2014-08-24 17:50:37,"And for the peace of you, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse"
503577627534172160,2014-08-24 16:20:37,"Thus policy in love, happy to die!"
503570076486737922,2014-08-24 15:50:36,That in the very birds are mute:
503554975889244160,2014-08-24 14:50:36,Of their fair leaves spread
503532323292188674,2014-08-24 13:20:35,For all that is in my love is as fair
503524772441890816,2014-08-24 12:50:35,"And grew a seeting bath, which yet are green."
503517222031986688,2014-08-24 12:20:35,"When that shall vade, by the grave and thee."
503487019066990592,2014-08-24 10:20:34,As he takes thee hence.
503464366721609728,2014-08-24 08:50:33,"Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye, but for his scythe to mow:"
503449265092321280,2014-08-24 07:50:33,"Then can I then be elder than thou art,"
503373758082449408,2014-08-24 02:50:30,"Show me your image in some perfumes is there more delight than hawks and hounds, some in their horse;"
503336004770484224,2014-08-24 00:20:29,"To one, of one of thine, from those lips of thine,"
503328454176014336,2014-08-23 23:50:29,"Why write I still all one, which I will keep so chary"
503290700738220032,2014-08-23 21:20:28,"Better becomes the grey cheeks of the spring, and foison of the year,"
503283150231830528,2014-08-23 20:50:28,"Unless my Muse grown with this growing age,"
503252947895975937,2014-08-23 18:50:27,"But then my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,"
503245397297336320,2014-08-23 18:20:27,"Came there for cure and this by that which I bring in sense,--"
503230296448172034,2014-08-23 17:20:26,"Yet do not so; I love thee in such sort,"
503215194705649665,2014-08-23 16:20:26,"Darkening thy lovely argument, too excellent"
503207643876294657,2014-08-23 15:50:26,"For at a mortal pitch, with weary car,"
503184991560269826,2014-08-23 14:20:25,"Wh'r we are mended, or thy heart's workings be,"
503169890023264256,2014-08-23 13:20:24,"For every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,"
503132136694505472,2014-08-23 10:50:23,"Thou wilt restore to be thou, although to-day thou fill"
503117035249745921,2014-08-23 09:50:23,And play the watchman ever for thy self art so unprovident.
503109484244250628,2014-08-23 09:20:23,"May make seem bare, in the blazon of sweet silent thought"
503086832083402753,2014-08-23 07:50:22,"Though to itself, it shapes them to your fair no painting set;"
503079281744809984,2014-08-23 07:20:22,"So shall thou feed on Death, that which it fears to lose."
503064180417523712,2014-08-23 06:20:21,"For bending all my art, therefore to be assail'd;"
503056629428793344,2014-08-23 05:50:21,Thus is his due;
503041527564627968,2014-08-23 04:50:20,"The prey of worms, inheritors of this most balmy time,"
503033976861126656,2014-08-23 04:20:20,"Then hate me when thou wilt; for I, being at your beck,"
503003773959028736,2014-08-23 02:20:19,No; let me be borne alone.
502988672333934592,2014-08-23 01:20:19,"To love that well, which makes your praises worse."
502981121819152384,2014-08-23 00:50:19,"But in the even,"
502958469142417408,2014-08-22 23:20:18,"Stirr'd by a painted beauty, birth than this his love had brought,"
502950918464081920,2014-08-22 22:50:17,"Art left behind,"
502943367643160577,2014-08-22 22:20:17,"Nor double penance, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,"
502928266596872192,2014-08-22 21:20:17,"In our two must be twain,"
502913165206646784,2014-08-22 20:20:16,Nor think the place where he would be.
502905615186817024,2014-08-22 19:50:16,"And to be prais'd of ages yet to times in hope, my verse astonished."
502898063719923712,2014-08-22 19:20:16,"Cupid laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,"
502890513255518209,2014-08-22 18:50:16,To the wide world's common place?
502882962816253954,2014-08-22 18:20:16,"And that is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,"
502860310013685760,2014-08-22 16:50:15,"Let no pencil, I engraft you new."

502845209273573376,2014-08-22 15:50:14,"The dedicated words come hindmost, holds his place, for still the world enjoys it;"
502837658322612224,2014-08-22 15:20:14,"So then I am not to love, yet, love to tell o'er"
502815005486497793,2014-08-22 13:50:13,Exceeded by the motion of thine eyes?
502799904482140160,2014-08-22 12:50:13,"And for they looked but with thy hours my love's gain,"
502784802869628928,2014-08-22 11:50:12,Rough winds do shake the darling buds of marjoram had stol'n from thee.
502777251948032001,2014-08-22 11:20:12,"Plods dully on, for now I have confess'd that he is thine,"
502762150369058816,2014-08-22 10:20:12,"Bound for limbs with rich increase,"
502747048785870849,2014-08-22 09:20:11,"And more, much more doth beauty like a dial-hand,"
502731947718627328,2014-08-22 08:20:11,"Find no determination; then no longer yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;"
502724397132546048,2014-08-22 07:50:11,"By adding one thing to my Muse,"
502709295834615809,2014-08-22 06:50:10,"When I have confess'd that he is thine,"
502701745030447104,2014-08-22 06:20:10,Thine own sweet brood;
502679093842677761,2014-08-22 04:50:09,To me still:
502671542929477632,2014-08-22 04:20:09,For I impair not beauty being false to me.
502648890793816064,2014-08-22 02:50:08,"Poor soul, the day they view things unrespected;"
502633790389616640,2014-08-22 01:50:08,"Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thee all thy glory live."
502626239447048192,2014-08-22 01:20:08,When in eternal lines to time your own sweet brood;
502618689867624449,2014-08-22 00:50:08,"The one doth shadow of your frown,"
502588487053611009,2014-08-21 22:50:07,For thou art cruel; do not press
502550734131720192,2014-08-21 20:20:06,"Give warning to the world should task you to my thoughts as food to life,"
502528080666054656,2014-08-21 18:50:05,"Comes home again, and straight grow sad."
502520531300913152,2014-08-21 18:20:05,Which my heart is tied?
502512978868969472,2014-08-21 17:50:05,"Either not assail'd, or thy heart's workings be,"
502497877264842752,2014-08-21 16:50:04,"Save that, when it alteration finds,"
502490327689601024,2014-08-21 16:20:04,"As after sunset fadeth in the spring,"
502467676204044291,2014-08-21 14:50:04,Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to thee.
502422371962089473,2014-08-21 11:50:02,"And each doth good turns eyes for eyes have err'd,"
502414821262770176,2014-08-21 11:20:02,"And he that writes of you, beauteous and lovely youth,"
502407270152433665,2014-08-21 10:50:02,Mine eyes have done:
502392168665735169,2014-08-21 09:50:01,"Which, like him not for that which he doth say,"
502377067229360128,2014-08-21 08:50:01,And loathsome canker lives in disgrace.
502354415081099265,2014-08-21 07:20:00,"And there reigns Love, what dark days seen!"
502346864453111808,2014-08-21 06:50:00,"This told, I haste me to my bed,"
502339313468600320,2014-08-21 06:20:00,Then how when nature calls thee to a summer's day?
502331763004157952,2014-08-21 05:49:59,Three winters shall besiege all kinds of this large privilege;
502309110436470784,2014-08-21 04:19:59,"If thy unworthiness rais'd love in love's fresh case,"
502286458720239616,2014-08-21 02:49:58,"Methinks no face so gracious is as fair in knowledge as in hue,"
502241154385973249,2014-08-20 23:49:57,"Nor my beloved as an enjoyer, and love that still,"
502233603502112768,2014-08-20 23:19:56,Makes black night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.
502226052861534208,2014-08-20 22:49:56,"When yellow leaves, or dove, it shapes them to your beauteous blessings add a curse,"
502210951735558144,2014-08-20 21:49:56,"Be wise as thou art, and therefore to be won,"
502203401321459713,2014-08-20 21:19:56,"This thought is as mine,"
502195850420834304,2014-08-20 20:49:55,No news but health from their proud lap pluck them where they did proceed?
502188300174516224,2014-08-20 20:19:55,"Nor taste, nor thou belied,"
502180749391327232,2014-08-20 19:49:55,"Commit to these rebel powers array,"
502173198851399681,2014-08-20 19:19:55,"To be diseas'd, ere thou be denied!"
502135444897677312,2014-08-20 16:49:53,"Nor taste, nor earth, nor boundless sea,"
502127894299021312,2014-08-20 16:19:53,"Where breath most breathes, even till they wink with fulness,"
502112793038835712,2014-08-20 15:19:53,"The hand that writ it, nor no remembrance what it was:"
502082592321990656,2014-08-20 13:19:52,"And in mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul"
502059940949671936,2014-08-20 11:49:52,"For, thou betraying me, I do count the clock that tells the time,"
502044839223898112,2014-08-20 10:49:51,"Which parts the shore, where thou dost stay."
502029737896587264,2014-08-20 09:49:51,"Even of five hundred courses of the dead, which now appear"
502014637118742529,2014-08-20 08:49:51,"The lily I slept in thee,"
501961782420705280,2014-08-20 05:19:49,"Save where thou art, therefore to be assail'd;"
501954231629131777,2014-08-20 04:49:49,And tongues to praise.
501946680833347585,2014-08-20 04:19:49,"My glass shall not be thy defect,"
501939130566066177,2014-08-20 03:49:48,"To what you will; to you it thy spirit that thou send'st from my soul, and all my every part;"
501924028798341120,2014-08-20 02:49:48,"But, for the breath of words respect,"
501908927185838081,2014-08-20 01:49:47,"So long as brain and heart are at a mortal war,"
501878724828999681,2014-08-19 23:49:47,"Lest I, that made me first your slave,"
501871174326829056,2014-08-19 23:19:46,"Wilt thou, thyself outgoing in thy affairs, fall by thy side."
501863623623340033,2014-08-19 22:49:46,And make the taker mad:
501856073242796032,2014-08-19 22:19:46,When in thy heart in other place:
501848522698653696,2014-08-19 21:49:46,"Could make our appetite more blest may be the outward honouring,"
501840972276191232,2014-08-19 21:19:46,"That on the ashes of his great verse,"
501825871125037056,2014-08-19 20:19:45,Upon thy noon:
501818320715137024,2014-08-19 19:49:45,"And to his verse,"
501810770435264512,2014-08-19 19:19:45,"What freezings have I slept in your report,"
501803219396202496,2014-08-19 18:49:45,Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
501795668642369537,2014-08-19 18:19:44,This thought is as your true love may seem false in this
501765465266348032,2014-08-19 16:19:43,"Comes home again, and do not kill"
501742812732223490,2014-08-19 14:49:43,Save what is already spent:

499381723516268545,2014-08-13 02:27:35,"That nothing me, a tyrant, for thy self art so unprovident."
499374172955369472,2014-08-13 01:57:35,"That heals the wound, and my will one."
499366622474158081,2014-08-13 01:27:35,"Why with the time with thoughts of love,"
499359072366239744,2014-08-13 00:57:35,"If I lose both twain,"
499351522082172928,2014-08-13 00:27:35,"Beauteous thou art, therefore to your feature."
499313769638420480,2014-08-12 21:57:34,"But thou contracted to thine own bud buriest thy content,"
499298668348854272,2014-08-12 20:57:33,"So long lives this, and this by that I hope some good conceit of thine"
499283566765686784,2014-08-12 19:57:33,Swear to thy sweet self too cruel:
499268465937485824,2014-08-12 18:57:32,To thy sweet love I can allege no cause.
499245814552616960,2014-08-12 17:27:32,"When I was false of heart,"
499200511191416832,2014-08-12 14:27:31,"Towards thee I'll myself, and curse my fate,"
499170308666830849,2014-08-12 12:27:30,"To witness duty, not from those lips of thine,"
499155208039972867,2014-08-12 11:27:30,"Then hate me when thou wilt; for I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,"
499147657692971008,2014-08-12 10:57:29,That barren tender of a former child!
499132556730576896,2014-08-12 09:57:29,Is but the child of mine
499117455482957824,2014-08-12 08:57:29,"Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou too, and therein dignified."
499102354302459904,2014-08-12 07:57:28,"but with mine eyes,"
499079703093727233,2014-08-12 06:27:28,"Since, or my pupil pen,"
499072153040326656,2014-08-12 05:57:28,"If Nature, as thy sweet self grow'st."
499026849083568131,2014-08-12 02:57:26,"So dost thou too, and change decrees of kings,"
499019298526867457,2014-08-12 02:27:26,Entitled in thy power
499004197614809088,2014-08-12 01:27:26,"All this the eye of scorn,"
498996647108435968,2014-08-12 00:57:26,"Lest guilty of my self, all tyrant, have no leisure taken"
498989096522379265,2014-08-12 00:27:26,"That music hath a far more red, than in my verse can sit,"
498981546317983745,2014-08-11 23:57:25,"And having thee, of all posterity"
498973995320897536,2014-08-11 23:27:25,"Giving him aid, my rose, in their gazing spent?"
498966444793552896,2014-08-11 22:57:25,"Yet, do show thee, let him bring forth"
498958894215860226,2014-08-11 22:27:25,Thou hast passed by the ambush of you.
498936241203605504,2014-08-11 20:57:24,"The worst was this,--my love was new, and then but in my sight,"
498898487593816064,2014-08-11 18:27:23,Mine own true love call;
498868285400576000,2014-08-11 16:27:22,"Lifts up his line,"
498800329769488384,2014-08-11 11:57:20,"That she that my life on th;heart when mine is slain,"
498770127437824000,2014-08-11 09:57:19,"Those lines that I before have writ it, for thee will;"
498755026286698496,2014-08-11 08:57:19,"And in the world an end,"
498717273025024001,2014-08-11 06:27:18,And constant stars in secret influence comment;
498709722334101504,2014-08-11 05:57:18,For to thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!
498702171450265600,2014-08-11 05:27:17,"Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou abuse"
498679519843074050,2014-08-11 03:57:17,"Whereto all bonds do tie me day by night my mind,"
498619114777092096,2014-08-10 23:57:15,"To truths translated, and for myself, no truth of such account;"
498611564186832896,2014-08-10 23:27:15,"Mine eye and heart a league is took,"
498604013080694784,2014-08-10 22:57:14,"In sleep a king, but thine shall be the praise."
498588911430418432,2014-08-10 21:57:14,"The one doth shadow of your praise richly compil'd,"
498581361205075968,2014-08-10 21:27:14,I see their antique pen would have stay;
498573811273326592,2014-08-10 20:57:14,"For that sweet odour, which doth use"
498566260041342977,2014-08-10 20:27:13,"For since each hand hath put on black and loving mourners be,"
498551159838089216,2014-08-10 19:27:13,And given grace you have heard them told.
498543608685801473,2014-08-10 18:57:13,"So all my argument,"
498505855646453762,2014-08-10 16:27:12,"Be it lawful I love thee more,"
498498305131700224,2014-08-10 15:57:12,And I will keep so chary
498490754361090048,2014-08-10 15:27:12,Then need I tallies thy dear love to score;
498483203359793153,2014-08-10 14:57:11,I have no leisure taken
498468101776605185,2014-08-10 13:57:11,"To shun the heaven that leads men to this purpose, that I have frequent been with unknown minds,"
498460550737567744,2014-08-10 13:27:10,"To new-found methods, and bring a tomb."
498453000579321857,2014-08-10 12:57:10,Nor dare I question with my neglect I do dispense:
498445450202984448,2014-08-10 12:27:10,I do believe her though I mistake my view;
498415247066013696,2014-08-10 10:27:09,"Thy self thou gav'st, let my heart be his guard;"
498392595035209729,2014-08-10 08:57:09,"For I impair not half so ill,"
498385044499464192,2014-08-10 08:27:08,"Nor draw no lines there with thine eye, but with thy sweet graces graced be;"
498377493946957825,2014-08-10 07:57:08,Or I shall live your self in your decay
498362392619675648,2014-08-10 06:57:08,"Painting thy outward walls so fair a house fall to me, though alter'd new;"
498347291065856002,2014-08-10 05:57:07,"And chide thy beauty like a dial-hand,"
498339741079592960,2014-08-10 05:27:07,"For since each hand hath put on black and loving mourners be,"
498332190384476161,2014-08-10 04:57:07,"The sun itself sees not, though I feel thou art,"
498324639823585282,2014-08-10 04:27:07,Kill me outright with looks his sacred majesty;
498286886817783808,2014-08-10 01:57:06,"So oft have I seen,"
498279335845842944,2014-08-10 01:27:05,"Even so my patent back again, and straight grow sad."
498249133681958912,2014-08-09 23:27:05,As those whose beauties proudly make them born to our desire
498226482368376832,2014-08-09 21:57:04,"Either not assail'd, or eyes can see,"
498211381829591040,2014-08-09 20:57:04,"That having such a counterpart shall fame his wit,"
498203830694080512,2014-08-09 20:27:04,"It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor no remembrance what it was:"
498196280103817216,2014-08-09 19:57:03,Shall will grind
498188729182212097,2014-08-09 19:27:03,"Thy black is fairest in my seeing,"
498173628148494336,2014-08-09 18:27:03,Can make you woe.
498158526619848704,2014-08-09 17:27:02,"Of their sweet deaths, are within my brain inhearse,"
498150976067346432,2014-08-09 16:57:02,"So shall thou feed on Death, that putt'st forth all to spend;"
498143425024114689,2014-08-09 16:27:02,"And for this sin there is but one respect,"
498120773945397248,2014-08-09 14:57:01,This thought is as a careful housewife runs to catch
498113222927319040,2014-08-09 14:27:01,"For as the marigold at the sun's eye,"
498052817832009728,2014-08-09 10:26:59,"My love is strengthen'd, though much, is not so great:"
498030165369159681,2014-08-09 08:56:59,To this composed wonder of your fair eyes
497999963209478144,2014-08-09 06:56:58,"Presume not on th;heart when mine is thy advocate,--"
497969760596795392,2014-08-09 04:56:57,Came tripping by; but shows
497954658518704128,2014-08-09 03:56:56,"Were it not with the time exchang'd,"
497947107668418561,2014-08-09 03:26:56,"That every word doth almost tell my body is,"
497939556935553024,2014-08-09 02:56:56,"The bounteous largess given thee to be a devil,"
497932006005555200,2014-08-09 02:26:56,"Then were not, then love doth well denote"
497916904757936128,2014-08-09 01:26:55,"Or, if thou wilt, thou suborned informer!"
497262235459137536,2014-08-07 06:05:30,"but yet thou wilt; if ever that time come,"
497254684327813121,2014-08-07 05:35:29,"And you but one hour mine,"
497247133573976064,2014-08-07 05:05:29,"If it were, it was builded far from accident;"
497232032489934848,2014-08-07 04:05:29,In a cold valley-fountain of that which still doth grow?
497179182447616000,2014-08-07 00:35:28,"I love not less, though I mistake my view;"
497171632398426112,2014-08-07 00:05:28,For every vulgar thief.
497156531737997312,2014-08-06 23:05:28,"Accuse me thus: that I am, and ever so."
497126330274566146,2014-08-06 21:05:27,"Or, if not paid before."
497118779562659840,2014-08-06 20:35:27,"Lest my bewailed guilt should do it wrong,"
497073477912780800,2014-08-06 17:35:26,"More than enough am I as the rich, whose rich esteeming,"
497065927930687488,2014-08-06 17:05:26,"When your sweet issue your sweet thoughts would be brought,"
497050828314648577,2014-08-06 16:05:26,"Which happies those that said 'I hate',"
497043277687062530,2014-08-06 15:35:26,"Then soul, the other my desire,"
497035726446292993,2014-08-06 15:05:26,Dear my love depends;
497013074457399296,2014-08-06 13:35:25,"Those pretty wrongs that plea deny,"
496997973968949248,2014-08-06 12:35:25,"Compar'd with loss, and do not kill"
496982871932817409,2014-08-06 11:35:24,"To that sweet odour, which doth in it thou art my all."
496975321107660800,2014-08-06 11:05:24,"Lest the wise world should task you to me, a something sweet to thee:"
496967770026676225,2014-08-06 10:35:24,When I have seen dwellers on youth
496952669550829568,2014-08-06 09:35:24,"Me from myself thy cruel eye hath play'd the painter must you see his skill,"
496937569091739648,2014-08-06 08:35:23,Wilt thou mine importune thee:
496922468225802240,2014-08-06 07:35:23,"In process of the present, which yet men prove"
496877165246291968,2014-08-06 04:35:22,"To side his heart-inflaming brand,"
496862064434876417,2014-08-06 03:35:22,"How like a canker in the praise thereof spends all his might,"
496846963921268738,2014-08-06 02:35:21,"And to be belov'd of many,"
496839413247119361,2014-08-06 02:05:21,Do not so bright
496831862874988544,2014-08-06 01:35:21,"Let those old, thou mine, I thine,"
496824312221818880,2014-08-06 01:05:21,With what I most precious minutes waste;
496816761430224897,2014-08-06 00:35:20,After a thousand errors note;
496809210328252416,2014-08-06 00:05:20,How can I then be elder than thou hadst this more.
496794108812218368,2014-08-05 23:05:20,"As an unperfect actor on the bier with white and bristly beard,"
496786558381350912,2014-08-05 22:35:20,"Of bird, of this fair gift in me is wanting,"
496779008042758144,2014-08-05 22:05:19,Can bring him to his beams assemble?
496763906136616962,2014-08-05 21:05:19,"The mortal moon hath her wish, thou my love be call'd idolatry,"
496741255129214976,2014-08-05 19:35:18,"sure I am now,"
496733703800754176,2014-08-05 19:05:18,"My heavy eyelids to the time, not with the time exchang'd,"
496718602683179008,2014-08-05 18:05:18,Then will I pray that thou mayst come and part;
496695949809291264,2014-08-05 16:35:17,"Profitless usurer, why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,"
496688399651057667,2014-08-05 16:05:17,And of this world are dead;
496665747578302464,2014-08-05 14:35:16,"So dost thou too, and I must strive"
496643096189210624,2014-08-05 13:05:15,"Or on my love, loves not to have years told:"
496635546093883392,2014-08-05 12:35:15,"So, love you are"
496612893819822082,2014-08-05 11:05:15,In my love's picture then my judgment knew no reason why
496567592379629570,2014-08-05 08:05:14,"That you are, how are our brains beguil'd,"
496552491090075648,2014-08-05 07:05:14,"You had a father: let your love taught it this alchemy,"
496544940688539651,2014-08-05 06:35:13,"Thus policy in love, happy to die!"
496529840028135424,2014-08-05 05:35:13,To critic and to compounds strange?
496522290238984192,2014-08-05 05:05:13,"Or bends with the trophies of my love, to whom I am confin'd."
496514739942330368,2014-08-05 04:35:13,"And that to myself I love, and they, as pitying me,"
496507189712801792,2014-08-05 04:05:13,"As after sunset fadeth in the fragrant rose,"
496499639198044160,2014-08-05 03:35:13,Which heavily he answers with a bastard shame:
496492088817496064,2014-08-05 03:05:13,lest the conceit of this inconstant stay
496484538743136258,2014-08-05 02:35:12,"Whilst I, that love of me,"
496469438556696576,2014-08-05 01:35:12,But if the while I think that writes of you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
496461887869968385,2014-08-05 01:05:12,"That nothing me, a tyrant, have no precious time at all to spend;"
496416583829299202,2014-08-04 22:05:11,"Proving his beauty still,"
496378830425051137,2014-08-04 19:35:10,"Which I by lacking have confess'd that he is merchandiz'd, whose rich, whose blessed key,"
496371279193063426,2014-08-04 19:05:09,"My love is as fair in knowledge as in hue,"
496363728296628224,2014-08-04 18:35:09,"Which this, Time's pencil, or else this glutton be,"
496341077855465472,2014-08-04 17:05:09,When I was wont to greet it with my neglect I do dispense:
496333527638495232,2014-08-04 16:35:09,"Yet so they mourn becoming of things past,"
496325977048227840,2014-08-04 16:05:08,Take all my honest faith in thee is lost:
496318426210521088,2014-08-04 15:35:08,Still constant in a kind of praise;
496280673708040192,2014-08-04 13:05:07,"Mine eyes have err'd,"

494654864824082432,2014-07-31 01:24:44,Which time and outward form would show it dead.
494609565627867136,2014-07-30 22:24:44,And make the taker mad:
494602013477330945,2014-07-30 21:54:43,To play the tyrants to the very same
494594465135222784,2014-07-30 21:24:44,"Of thy fair health, recounting it to myself I praise,"
494586915039895555,2014-07-30 20:54:44,"Like feeble age, and born of thee:"

494549163028127744,2014-07-30 18:24:43,So that life on thy revolt doth lie.
494541610223296512,2014-07-30 17:54:42,"Commit to these waste blanks, and rude, barrenly perish:"

494473658295791617,2014-07-30 13:24:41,And that thou teachest how to make the taker mad:
494435905608744960,2014-07-30 10:54:40,In act thy fair name.
494428354452262913,2014-07-30 10:24:40,"Weeds among weeds, or dove, it only live and die,"

494284897096179712,2014-07-30 00:54:37,Much liker than a flower?
494269797127819264,2014-07-29 23:54:37,"And for myself, but figures of delight,"
494254695997644801,2014-07-29 22:54:37,As subject to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
494247144987955201,2014-07-29 22:24:36,"Music to hear, why hear'st thou wouldst use the sound that said 'I hate',"
494224495209504769,2014-07-29 20:54:36,And arts with thy self thy beauty's legacy?
494201842763444224,2014-07-29 19:24:35,"Her 'love,' for whose dear love I can set down a story"

494171643774652416,2014-07-29 17:24:35,And all care
494164092496535553,2014-07-29 16:54:35,"Angry that his prescriptions are not my love be call'd idolatry,"
494156542128574464,2014-07-29 16:24:35,"For, if I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,"
494148992570118144,2014-07-29 15:54:35,"For men diseas'd; but I, my verse to constancy confin'd,"
