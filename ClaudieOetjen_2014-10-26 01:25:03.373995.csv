476378174553464832,2014-06-10 14:59:42,WAS I HIGH ON DRUGS WHEN I LIKED YOU
471857805532467200,2014-05-29 03:37:22,You are the only one who makes me look forward to tomorrow.
471678858798723072,2014-05-28 15:46:17,The little things mean the most.
471610832741076992,2014-05-28 11:15:59,No one texts faster than a pissed off girl.
471579527911440384,2014-05-28 09:11:35,"When I fight with you, I'm really fighting for us. If I didn't care, I wouldn't bother."
471425244339503104,2014-05-27 22:58:31,"I text you because I want to have a conversation with you, not to get one word answers."
471403592964775936,2014-05-27 21:32:29,"We don't talk anymore, and the saddest part is, we used to talk everyday."
471230518223073280,2014-05-27 10:04:45,"You see that girl staring into space? If you were to ask what's wrong, she would say nothing, when in reality its everything."
471210117921132544,2014-05-27 08:43:41,I miss the old you. ♥
471190256297857025,2014-05-27 07:24:46,"No matter who broke your heart, or how long it takes to heal, youll never get through it without your friends."
471170208090959872,2014-05-27 06:05:06,"I'm not jealous, I just don’t like that bitch."
471150793471455234,2014-05-27 04:47:57,"Best Text Messages: Those random ""I miss you"" messages, waking up to a ""good morning beautiful"" text, and always an ""I love you"" text."
471131288749871104,2014-05-27 03:30:27,You still mean everything to me.
471111581141442560,2014-05-27 02:12:08,"A lie is still a lie, regardless of the reason behind it. You can say you did it for a good cause but the point is, you still did it."
471092091552923649,2014-05-27 00:54:41,"I hate how I'm always excited to talk to you, and you act like you just don't care."
471072712748580864,2014-05-26 23:37:41,A little jealousy in a relationship shows the person that you care about them.
471053158932676608,2014-05-26 22:19:59,"3 words, 8 letters, 1 regret. I miss you."
471033754467586048,2014-05-26 21:02:53,"I want you permanently, not temporarily."
471014159878852608,2014-05-26 19:45:01,"We met, we talked, we liked, we called, we texted, we dated, we committed, I loved, you cheated, we're done, you're deleted."
470994577331990529,2014-05-26 18:27:12,"If you're mine, you're only mine. I don't share."
470974927793696771,2014-05-26 17:09:07,Perfect Relationship = Two people never giving up on each other.
470955410950610944,2014-05-26 15:51:34,Don't let idiots ruin your day.
470936034562166784,2014-05-26 14:34:34,I just want things to go back to the way they used to be.
470916605837193216,2014-05-26 13:17:22,God will never let you down but people will.
470897157977829376,2014-05-26 12:00:05,I don't know why but every time I hear your name I just smile.
470877616312836097,2014-05-26 10:42:26,She wants you to look at her like you've never looked at anyone else. She wants you to look at her like she has something other girls don't
470858182974132224,2014-05-26 09:25:13,There's always that one person that you've had feelings for since the moment you first met them.
470838737971081216,2014-05-26 08:07:57,I hate fighting with the one person who makes me smile the most.
470819078391615488,2014-05-26 06:49:50,"She ignores all the guys that want her, because she's too wrapped up in the one who doesn't."
470799370154037249,2014-05-26 05:31:31,I'd hug you all day if I could.
470779623916064769,2014-05-26 04:13:03,You are the only one who makes me look forward to tomorrow.
470760184004886528,2014-05-26 02:55:48,Can we be more than friends already?
470740713731145729,2014-05-26 01:38:26,"I love you takes 3 seconds to say, 3 hours to explain a lifetime to prove."
470721277771014145,2014-05-26 00:21:12,Proof me that you love me. ❤
470701812899524608,2014-05-25 23:03:52,"Hi someone, I like you but I'm not sure if you feel the same way."
470682220378611713,2014-05-25 21:46:00,"I want someone who loves me, who cares for real, someone who gives their all to me and makes time for me, no matter what."
470662658216034304,2014-05-25 20:28:16,"You fight like a married couple, you talk like best friends, and you flirt like first loves, so obviously it's meant to be."
470642926876246016,2014-05-25 19:09:52,It is never too late to make things right.
470623390009524224,2014-05-25 17:52:14,Old couples make you realize someone can love you forever.
470603969882906624,2014-05-25 16:35:04,"The worst feeling is pretending you don't care about something, when really it's all you seem to think about."
470584420273881090,2014-05-25 15:17:23,I don't know why but every time I hear your name I just smile.
470564865757569024,2014-05-25 13:59:41,All i want is a perfect relationship with you. ❤
470545382972203008,2014-05-25 12:42:16,"I text you because I want to have a conversation with you, not to get one word answers."
470525960421253120,2014-05-25 11:25:05,I miss talking to you for hours.
470506342151499776,2014-05-25 10:07:08,"Touch her heart, not her body. Steal her attention, not her virginity. Make her smile, don't waste her tears."
470486574799417344,2014-05-25 08:48:35,I overreact. I over think everything. I dream big &amp; when I say I love you I'm not lying.
470466986531500032,2014-05-25 07:30:45,"Tell me I was wrong. Come back, and fight for me. Prove that I'm not useless."
470447621169897472,2014-05-25 06:13:48,I wish you were here.
470428159427362816,2014-05-25 04:56:28,I want to be the reason you smile every time you check your phone.
470408497134174208,2014-05-25 03:38:20,When I find a song that relates to my current situation I listen to it over and over.
470388840935350272,2014-05-25 02:20:13,Those songs that express the feelings you can't say.
470369411958730752,2014-05-25 01:03:01,I'm single because I will wait for you.
470350048497111041,2014-05-24 23:46:04,"Imagine we'd lay on each others arms , like I'm yours and you're mine ❤"
470330667704676352,2014-05-24 22:29:04,"I always wonder if you're waiting for me to text you first, just like how i'm always waiting for you to text me first."
470311235158671360,2014-05-24 21:11:51,A boyfriend should always send you a Good morning &amp; Good night text even if you don't talk all day just to let you know you're on his mind.
470291590204764160,2014-05-24 19:53:47,I kinda like someone who gets jealous and protective but still trusts me.
470271597735976960,2014-05-24 18:34:20,When he tells you that you're the most beautiful girl in the world. &gt;&gt;
470251914328698882,2014-05-24 17:16:07,I hate it when people get in a relationship and forget about their friends.
470232282750390273,2014-05-24 15:58:07,"If she wakes up to a text that said something like ""good morning, beautiful"" or ""Have a good day, gorgeous"" tomorrow, it would make her day."
470212653369925633,2014-05-24 14:40:07,I want a boyfriend who's proud to be with me.
470192905802375169,2014-05-24 13:21:39,"I may flirt, but it's only because I'm single. As soon as I get in a relationship, that shit STOPS."
470173100999335937,2014-05-24 12:02:57,"3 words, 8 letters, 1 regret. I miss you."
470153563482517504,2014-05-24 10:45:19,You still make me smile even though you're the reason why I'm sad.
470133875612475393,2014-05-24 09:27:05,"I love you takes 3 seconds to say, 3 hours to explain a lifetime to prove."
470114462993633281,2014-05-24 08:09:56,"Sometimes, All I need a good friend to make me smile and laugh, to make me feel better, to listen to my problems, to understand me."
470095122390982656,2014-05-24 06:53:05,Pain changes people.
470075759273324545,2014-05-24 05:36:09,The little things mean the most.
470056410869268481,2014-05-24 04:19:16,Seeing your ex downgrade is the best feeling ever.
470036811717165057,2014-05-24 03:01:23,First date = awkward. First kiss = heavenly. First love = irreplaceable. First heartbreak = unforgettable.
470017185796993024,2014-05-24 01:43:24,"I'm difficult, I'm weird, and I get jealous easily, but I'll love you like there's no tomorrow."
469996981863976960,2014-05-24 00:23:07,"Stop with the excuses, start with the apologies."
469976142254850048,2014-05-23 23:00:18,"Why does everyone say, ""if you love someone, set them free""? If you really love someone, hold on tight and never let go."
469955017353330688,2014-05-23 21:36:22,"You're pretty, girl. Don't waste your pretty face and your expensive tears for the guy who left you. He doesn't deserve you."
469935061781852160,2014-05-23 20:17:04,"I love being alone, but I hate being lonely."
469915625499156481,2014-05-23 18:59:50,"Suicide is stupid? You wanna know what is stupid? Hurting someone so much emotionally, that they think suicide is the only answer."
469896020336197632,2014-05-23 17:41:56,The worst feeling in the world is when you know that you both love each other but still you just can't be together.
469876569532424193,2014-05-23 16:24:38,I just want to tell you that I love you so much.
469857098830860288,2014-05-23 15:07:16,You still make me smile even though you're the reason why I'm sad.
469837406598746112,2014-05-23 13:49:01,I hope you also miss me.
469817762294927360,2014-05-23 12:30:57,"Ladies, you don't need a boy to be happy. Remember that."
469797706890625024,2014-05-23 11:11:16,"I can't lose you. Because if I ever did, I'd have lost my best friend, my soul mate, my smile, my laugh, my everything."
469777867761397761,2014-05-23 09:52:26,I'm so happy to have found someone like you - cause without you I don't know what I would do.
469758045510062082,2014-05-23 08:33:40,"Life is too short to worry about stupid things. Have fun, fall in love, and regret nothing."
469737571598073857,2014-05-23 07:12:19,I need more hellos and less goodbyes.
469596848777220097,2014-05-22 21:53:08,"""Good morning, beautiful :)"" That's all it takes."
469596452201574400,2014-05-22 21:51:33,"I never needed you, I wanted you, there's a difference."
469569792190337024,2014-05-22 20:05:37,You still mean everything to me.
469549019325140993,2014-05-22 18:43:04,Caring too much will only get you hurt.
469529537873596416,2014-05-22 17:25:39,"No matter who broke your heart, or how long it takes to heal, youll never get through it without your friends."
469509511871340545,2014-05-22 16:06:05,"One smile, can start a friendship. One word, can end a fight. One look, can save a relationship. One person can change your life."
469489554592784384,2014-05-22 14:46:47,"A perfect relationship isn’t actually perfect at all, it consists of two people who NEVER give up on each other despite any hurt or pain."
469469592008413184,2014-05-22 13:27:27,"When I text/call you it's because I miss you, when I don't...it's because I'm waiting for you to miss me."
469450252374663168,2014-05-22 12:10:36,Good morning texts. Kisses on the forehead. Long goodbyes. Tight hugs. Holding hands. Silence that isn't awkward. Waking up beside you... ♥
469430854884655104,2014-05-22 10:53:32,All i want is a perfect relationship with you. ❤
469411548419473408,2014-05-22 09:36:49,"I didn't choose to fall in love with you, my heart did."
469392100673351680,2014-05-22 08:19:32,Thanks for texting me first and then ignoring my reply.
469372747127091201,2014-05-22 07:02:38,"You can't be ""just friends"" with someone you're madly in love with."
469352423329636352,2014-05-22 05:41:52,I miss how easy things used to be.
469331535834140672,2014-05-22 04:18:52,"The worst feeling is pretending you don't care about something, when really it's all you seem to think about."
469310574610763776,2014-05-22 02:55:35,"Life is too short to worry about stupid things. Have fun, fall in love, and regret nothing."
469290517247705088,2014-05-22 01:35:52,"I'm sad, hurt, angry, mad, disappointed. But you know what? I'll put on a happy face and move on. It will hurt but I will survive."
469270686133809152,2014-05-22 00:17:04,I wish you were here.
469249734016643072,2014-05-21 22:53:49,"I want someone who loves me, who cares for real, someone who gives their all to me and makes time for me, no matter what."
469229480729264130,2014-05-21 21:33:20,"Tell me I was wrong. Come back, and fight for me. Prove that I'm not useless."
469209158160371712,2014-05-21 20:12:35,Do me a favor please? Love me with all your heart. ♥
469188619064705024,2014-05-21 18:50:58,Just because I don't talk to you it doesn't mean I still don't think about you. I'm just distancing myself because I know I can't have you.
469168936487890945,2014-05-21 17:32:45,That one conversation that changed everything.
469149403245051904,2014-05-21 16:15:08,Forever feeling like a second option.
469130012075900928,2014-05-21 14:58:05,"When a guy likes you... he'll text you a lot, stay up every night with you, compliment you, and always have time for you."
469110481915887616,2014-05-21 13:40:29,"You taught me how to love, but you didn't teach me how to stop."
469091211983065088,2014-05-21 12:23:54,"Right now, someone you haven't met is out there wondering what it would be like to meet someone like you."
469071513585336320,2014-05-21 11:05:38,"When I text/call you it's because I miss you, when I don't...it's because I'm waiting for you to miss me."
469052152891969536,2014-05-21 09:48:42,I miss having you to talk to whenever I wanted.
469032208200499200,2014-05-21 08:29:27,"I'm sad, hurt, angry, mad, disappointed. But you know what? I'll put on a happy face and move on. It will hurt but I will survive."
469012275525718016,2014-05-21 07:10:14,Someone who can make you laugh &gt;
468992855965319169,2014-05-21 05:53:05,"You still like him, stop lying to yourself."
468973193538314240,2014-05-21 04:34:57,I don't know why but every time I hear your name I just smile.
468953211542724608,2014-05-21 03:15:33,You. No one else. Just you ♥
468933653989695488,2014-05-21 01:57:50,Old couples make you realize someone can love you forever.
468915795951886336,2014-05-21 00:46:52,Those songs that express the feelings you can't say.
468896321521606656,2014-05-20 23:29:29,Proof me that you love me. ❤
468876527481155584,2014-05-20 22:10:50,"I don't want perfect, I want real."
468856613215162368,2014-05-20 20:51:42,"When you fall for someone's personality, everything about them becomes beautiful."
468836972375445504,2014-05-20 19:33:39,Never let a girl go to bed mad or sad.
468817143207702528,2014-05-20 18:14:51,It is never too late to make things right.
468797659776421888,2014-05-20 16:57:26,I don't want to talk to anyone unless It's you.
468778198612709377,2014-05-20 15:40:06,I wish you were here.
468758683942256640,2014-05-20 14:22:34,"They ignore you now, but they'll need you later."
468739408988889089,2014-05-20 13:05:58,"I want you to love me for who I am, not who you want me to be."
468719856519356416,2014-05-20 11:48:16,I'm lucky to have you.
468700442667393024,2014-05-20 10:31:08,I hate when boys think they can get every girl.
468680975036063744,2014-05-20 09:13:46,"Don't judge me. You can't handle half of what I've dealt with. There's a reason I do the things I do, there's a reason I am who I am."
