446529733136617472,2014-03-20 06:12:39,"To be honest, you're the only one I've ever spent this much time on."
446509883727163392,2014-03-20 04:53:46,"I cant promise you a perfect relationship without arguments &amp; differences. But I can promise you as long as you're trying, I'm staying."
446490164982853632,2014-03-20 03:35:25,I'm tired of getting my hopes up for things that I know will never happen.
446470336909815809,2014-03-20 02:16:38,Screw what they say. You're worth it to me.
446450334341554176,2014-03-20 00:57:09,She's strong because she knows what it's like to be weak. She keeps her guard up because she knows what it's like to cry herself to sleep.
446430777803571201,2014-03-19 23:39:26,Give her your hoodie or your sweatshirt so she doesn't miss you as much when you're not around.
446411036619718656,2014-03-19 22:20:59,"A boyfriend shouldn't just be a boyfriend. To have it happier and more worthwhile, he should also be your very best friend."
446391253820010496,2014-03-19 21:02:23,The best relationships are the ones you didn't expect to be in; the ones you never saw coming.
446371790231572480,2014-03-19 19:45:02,"I wish you knew how much I like you, how much I love talking to you, and how much I wish you were mine."
446352419232833537,2014-03-19 18:28:04,I constantly tell myself ''I'm done'' but then I find myself trying again...
446333141767057408,2014-03-19 17:11:28,"I notice everything, I just act like I don't."
446313853609967618,2014-03-19 15:54:49,I really fucking miss you.
446294439212756992,2014-03-19 14:37:40,"Don't trust words, trust actions."
446274933455200256,2014-03-19 13:20:10,Do I ever cross your mind?
446255531720572928,2014-03-19 12:03:04,"I just want you. That's all. All your flaws, mistakes, smiles, frowns, giggles, jokes, sarcasm, everything. I just want you."
446236280825708544,2014-03-19 10:46:34,"We're not dating, but you're still mine."
446216748363046912,2014-03-19 09:28:57,"You're kinda, sorta, basically, pretty much always on my mind."
446197139450757120,2014-03-19 08:11:02,"When a girl cries for a guy, it means she really misses him. But when a guy cries for a girl, nobody can love that girl more than him."
446177632153923584,2014-03-19 06:53:31,Explaining your feelings to someone is one of the hardest things to do.
446158012428730368,2014-03-19 05:35:34,"When a girl ends a conversation with, ""K BYE"" you can be certain you just pissed her off."
446138280828891136,2014-03-19 04:17:09,"I’m not perfect, but I’m loyal."
446118761574039552,2014-03-19 02:59:35,"If he misses you, he'll call. If he cares, he'll show it. If not, he can't be worth your time because you're obviously not worth his."
446099362976784386,2014-03-19 01:42:30,"The worst feeling is pretending you don't care about something, when really it's all you seem to think about."
446079981714546688,2014-03-19 00:25:30,"Don't feel sad over someone who gave up on you, feel sorry for them because they gave up on someone who would have never given up on them."
446060440833908736,2014-03-18 23:07:51,"Good relationships don't just happen. They take time, patience and two people getting through all the hard times together."
446040474076209153,2014-03-18 21:48:30,I still remember the first day I met you.
446020227407433729,2014-03-18 20:28:03,"A smile can hide so much.. Fear, pain, sadness, tears.. But then again, they all reflect on one thing. Strength."
446000834585702400,2014-03-18 19:10:59,"You meet thousands of people, and none of them really mean anything to you. And then you meet one person, and your life is changed forever."
445980535111049216,2014-03-18 17:50:20,I still remember the first time we kissed.
445960443266228224,2014-03-18 16:30:29,I seriously can't stop thinking about you.
445940965904113664,2014-03-18 15:13:06,Being strong doesn't always mean you can handle what's thrown at you. It just means you're prepared to ignore whatever it is that hurts you.
445921555063640064,2014-03-18 13:55:58,"I know I'm made of mistakes, disappointments, and failures, but trust me, there's a part of me worth keeping. ♥"
445902017324515328,2014-03-18 12:38:20,"You have no idea how much I like you, how much you make me smile, how much I love talking to you, or how much I wish you were mine."
445882324995956736,2014-03-18 11:20:05,"When I'm with you, hours feel like seconds. When we're apart, days feel like years."
445862959965691904,2014-03-18 10:03:08,I want you to be happy. But I want to be the reason.
445843537376989184,2014-03-18 08:45:57,When a guy is proud to show off his girlfriend &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; :)
445824177971281921,2014-03-18 07:29:01,The prettiest smiles hide the deepest secrets. The prettiest eyes have cried the most tears. And the kindest hearts have felt the most pain.
445804792154038272,2014-03-18 06:11:59,"She comes off as strong, but maybe she fell asleep crying. She acts like nothing is wrong, but maybe she's just really good at lying."
445785402251542528,2014-03-18 04:54:56,"If you make a girl laugh, she likes you, but if you make her cry, she loves you."
445765929784201217,2014-03-18 03:37:34,You can't stay mad at someone who makes you smile.
445746526157946881,2014-03-18 02:20:28,"I cant promise you a perfect relationship without arguments &amp; differences. But I can promise you as long as you're trying, I'm staying."
445727150771945472,2014-03-18 01:03:28,"When i care about someone, i really care."
445707839030300673,2014-03-17 23:46:44,I hate acting like I don't care when it's really tearing me up inside.
445688341757841408,2014-03-17 22:29:15,"You ignore me, but I like you. You don't do anything, but I fell in love with you. I miss you, though I know you don't ever think about me."
445668736691748864,2014-03-17 21:11:21,"I try not to miss you, I try to let go, but in the end, you're always on my mind."
445649169705730049,2014-03-17 19:53:36,"A jealous girlfriend is a faithful girlfriend. If she doesn't get jealous when someone has your attention, it's because someone has hers."
445629831938469888,2014-03-17 18:36:45,"I just want you to miss me, I just want you to care, I just want you to text me first."
445610387296100352,2014-03-17 17:19:30,"The worst feeling is pretending you don't care about something, when really it's all you seem to think about."
445590895316836353,2014-03-17 16:02:02,I miss you a little more each day.
445571473030148097,2014-03-17 14:44:52,My attitude is based on how you treat me.
445552134075871232,2014-03-17 13:28:01,A real man is not a man who says nice things to women. A real man is a man who say nice things and his actions back those words up.
445532580855558144,2014-03-17 12:10:19,I want a relationship that lasts.
445513083159457792,2014-03-17 10:52:50,"One day, someone will walk into your life and make you see why it never worked out with anyone else."
445493717466497024,2014-03-17 09:35:53,"Text her saying ""Hey Beautiful"" Trust me, It'll make her whole day."
445474322832838656,2014-03-17 08:18:49,"You're the boy, she's the girl. You text her first or you guys don't talk today."
445454952589045760,2014-03-17 07:01:51,Overthinking killed my happiness. Insecurities killed my self-esteem. Lies killed my trust
445435225007349760,2014-03-17 05:43:28,"There's always a real reason behind every ""just wondering""."
445415093606440960,2014-03-17 04:23:28,I hate when I miss someone and can't do anything about it.
445395211829518336,2014-03-17 03:04:28,"Small things that mean a lot: Cute texts, tight hugs, long replies, holding hands, remembering the little things, &amp; kisses on the forehead."
445251807766249472,2014-03-16 17:34:38,It's crazy how much I miss and think of you at night.
445231618588819457,2014-03-16 16:14:24,"The worst feeling is pretending you don't care about something, when really it's all you seem to think about."
445211552862330882,2014-03-16 14:54:40,Nothing feels better than a surprise text from that person you miss.
445191375818985472,2014-03-16 13:34:29,Life becomes so much better when you decide not to care. Just live for the moment and don't let the drama bring you down.
445170887956762625,2014-03-16 12:13:05,I miss you and I wish you could realize it.
445150754282561536,2014-03-16 10:53:04,"I need someone who won’t give up on me, no matter how many times I mess up."
445130664774361088,2014-03-16 09:33:15,"While you're ignoring her, another guy is giving her attention, and while you're giving her problems, another guy is listening."
445110997548666880,2014-03-16 08:15:06,"Why am I so afraid to lose you, when you're not even mine."
445091367455166464,2014-03-16 06:57:06,"The couples that are meant to be, are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart, and come out even stronger."
445071940324052992,2014-03-16 05:39:54,"I forgive easily, but honestly I never forget."
445051737217331201,2014-03-16 04:19:37,I hate it when you talk to someone every single day day and then it just stops. All of a sudden neither of you say a damn word to each other
445031856728064000,2014-03-16 03:00:37,"Yes, I've changed. Pain does that to people."
445012359895977984,2014-03-16 01:43:09,"No matter how ""busy"" a persons day might be. If they ""really care"", they'll always find time for you."
444992978486964225,2014-03-16 00:26:08,"To be honest, you're the only one I've ever spent this much time on."
444973429179957248,2014-03-15 23:08:27,"Ever had a text that broke your heart? Yeah, me too."
444954246954221569,2014-03-15 21:52:13,A real man can't stand seeing his woman hurt. He is careful with his decisions and actions so he never have to be responsible for her pain.
444934639761633280,2014-03-15 20:34:19,I turned out liking you a lot more than I originally planned.
444915205042995200,2014-03-15 19:17:05,I want you to be happy. But I want to be the reason.
444895790675144704,2014-03-15 17:59:56,"I wanted to text you, but then I remembered we don't talk anymore.."
444876321739399168,2014-03-15 16:42:35,I'm strong because I know my weaknesses. I'm wise because I've been foolish. I laugh because I've known sadness.
444856888929181696,2014-03-15 15:25:22,Your lips? I kiss that. Your Body? l hug that. My smile? You cause that. Your heart? I want that.
444837312459841536,2014-03-15 14:07:34,"Sometimes you miss the memories, not the person."
444817686527086592,2014-03-15 12:49:35,A relationship where you can be weird together &gt;
444798222624509952,2014-03-15 11:32:14,It's crazy how much I miss and think of you at night.

444719868143616000,2014-03-15 06:20:53,I'm not perfect but I'll do my best for you.
444699919744368642,2014-03-15 05:01:37,"She's strong enough to walk away, but broken enough to look back."
444679995164594176,2014-03-15 03:42:27,I instantly smile when I get a text from you. It doesn't matter what it says. It's just amazing that for that minute I crossed your mind.
444660005694763008,2014-03-15 02:23:01,"Seriously, I want to cuddle with you right now."
444639950961516545,2014-03-15 01:03:19,"You're kinda, sorta, basically, pretty much always on my mind."

444559997851017217,2014-03-14 19:45:37,"I’m officially done trying. If you want me in your life, you can come find me. Until then, continue treating me like I don’t exist."
