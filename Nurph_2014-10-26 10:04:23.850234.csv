524862719275847680,2014-10-22 09:59:58,@EMomNowAB Glad to hear Nurph seems easy to use :) Is the chat on every week?
524862649964986368,2014-10-22 09:59:41,@BoxSocialYEG Hi! That's great! How was #EMomNowAB? :)

524859108932194304,2014-10-22 09:45:37,@EdTechSandyK Hi! Thanks for the question! Feel free to tweet the questions as you normally would :) Nurph doesn't automatically tweet them.

524271310332260352,2014-10-20 18:49:55,@SocialWhirled E.g. we do this with #Nurph and just have a placeholder topic which we can edit before the chat occurs.
524271184909987840,2014-10-20 18:49:25,@SocialWhirled If the chat is on the same time every week it might be good to create a few placeholder ones in advance just to be sure :)
524271015061647360,2014-10-20 18:48:45,@SocialWhirled It might be best to create a new chat event as there isn't an edit feature for past chats yet :)

509747693426843648,2014-09-10 16:58:15,There have been fantastic tweets about the kind of metrics to track the success of your chat. #Nurph

509747347388391425,2014-09-10 16:56:52,@vegecomgirl @BGlatzeder Sure! Replays are fun because you can continue to interact with the tweets past the schedule chat time. #Nurph

509745645184626688,2014-09-10 16:50:07,@vegecomgirl @kavita1010 Do you track the engagement of each tweet with a link to the Storify? Maybe another metric to monitor. #Nurph
509745029083320320,2014-09-10 16:47:40,@vegecomgirl thanks for the Storify insights there! I just realised we're still on Q1! So many great answers to this one :) #Nurph
509744538660118528,2014-09-10 16:45:43,"@vegecomgirl ah ha I spoke too soon - you did a new trick by breaking down the answers by guest and participant, is that right? :) #Nurph"

509742797776498688,2014-09-10 16:38:48,@Eggdough Sure! If you can start building a core group of repeat participants then you know it's a success :) #Nurph
509742127031795713,2014-09-10 16:36:08,"@vegecomgirl @Luv4Social e.g. the more people you have engaging with the announcement tweets, the more interest in the topic(?). #Nurph"
509741955073736704,2014-09-10 16:35:27,@vegecomgirl @Luv4Social I guess the engagement rate is a good one for looking at the announcement tweets of a chat? #Nurph
509741472070246400,2014-09-10 16:33:32,@vegecomgirl @Luv4Social I've mostly just used the Follower graph so far! Look forward to diving in to it further. #Nurph
509741331116482560,2014-09-10 16:32:58,@vegecomgirl @Luv4Social Great :) Are there any other metrics in Twitter Analytics that you like to check? #Nurph
509740898192990208,2014-09-10 16:31:15,@vegecomgirl @Luv4Social Maybe the number of new Followers for the chat host Twitter Account too? That might be an easy one to track. #Nurph
509740576657666048,2014-09-10 16:29:58,@abowersock @LisaMarieMary Hi! If you scroll up a little on the timeline it will work as a makeshift Pause effect :) #BufferChat

509739402357399552,2014-09-10 16:25:18,"@vegecomgirl then you can also start to monitor ""success"" in terms of how popular the invitations are (among all other metrics). #Nurph"
509739118327517184,2014-09-10 16:24:10,@vegecomgirl @Luv4Social Yes it would be interesting to know the success rate of a text-only tweet versus one with an image. #Nurph

505356483383820288,2014-08-29 14:09:09,@TheRealSJR BTW I just spotted you're in the UK too! :) Is there an #UsFitties Twitter Chat coming up soon?
505356262687928322,2014-08-29 14:08:16,@TheRealSJR Thanks for the further advice &amp; insights again! :) Do you have many more Q&amp;A-style chats lined-up for next week?
505350849275887616,2014-08-29 13:46:46,@CBarrows It's great to see you Nurphin' it up! :)
505349862683328512,2014-08-29 13:42:50,@CBarrows @LinkedIn ...by taking the slower-paced @-replies (outside of chats) in to a real-time discussion.
505349691278897152,2014-08-29 13:42:10,@CBarrows @LinkedIn Sending an @-reply is about as simple as it gets in terms of online communication! And Twitter Chats extend this...
505348985402707968,2014-08-29 13:39:21,@CBarrows @LinkedIn Yes! Because Twitter is such a streamlined communication tool it makes it easy to connect with likeminded professionals.
505347481740509184,2014-08-29 13:33:23,@LisaLFlowers Phew thanks for letting me know about that :) Are you happy to try Nurph again for your next chat?

505346800224841728,2014-08-29 13:30:40,@LisaLFlowers Sorry to hear that! :) It might be because the Internet connection dropped briefly. Are you using Wi-fi?

504542222248062976,2014-08-27 08:13:34,@bekblayton Sorry for the slow response to this one! Nurph shows tweets from people using other tools too :)
504541585284288513,2014-08-27 08:11:02,@RachelOrr @bellaale Sorry for the slow response on this! :) We're fixing the issue that prevented the tweet from showing up :)
504539822812577792,2014-08-27 08:04:02,@RachelOrr Thanks again :) We're eager to launch dedicated mobile and tablet apps. Do you use TweetDeck on iPad and desktop too?
504538892130066432,2014-08-27 08:00:20,@RachelOrr Or did it prevent you from doing that too?
504538844193366016,2014-08-27 08:00:08,@RachelOrr Thanks a lot for the further info and sorry to hear that. Were you able to press the Home button and return to the home screen?..
504537197903892480,2014-08-27 07:53:36,@bekblayton Thanks for the further insights in to the benefits of those :) Do you use Tweetbot on your desktop computer too or just iPad?

504536083217276928,2014-08-27 07:49:10,@Y6teacher Thanks for the further info! Much appreciated :) Was it the full browser that you had to shut or the browser tab with Nurph open?

504533851717533696,2014-08-27 07:40:18,@redhappyshoes Thanks for the further info! It might be an issue that I need to resolve here :) Do you participate in any other chats?
504533161456705536,2014-08-27 07:37:34,@TeacherToolkit Yes people can still be recorded without chatting on Nurph :) Some people can chat via Nurph others can use their fav tools!
504532840483397632,2014-08-27 07:36:17,@TeacherToolkit Sure that's something we can look in to :) And making it easier to see the On/Off switch too...continued...

486909577561391107,2014-07-09 16:27:44,@GoGetterVette When people already have a fan-base / Following they automatically have an Audience for their chats. #Nurph
486909444241240065,2014-07-09 16:27:12,@GoGetterVette I was just wondering if there's a company or industry VIP who could start a digital project management chat. #Nurph

486908710267396097,2014-07-09 16:24:17,@GoGetterVette Not a problem :) Maybe there's a community out there who might be interested in starting that up. #Nurph
