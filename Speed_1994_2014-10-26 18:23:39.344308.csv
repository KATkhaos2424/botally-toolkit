521144753442656256,2014-10-12 03:46:06,We're not going to shoot them right?
521129653205884928,2014-10-12 02:46:06,Maybe we can do something about those hostages.

521099452317057024,2014-10-12 00:46:05,This is taking way too long. How much you think that elevator weighs?

520978661000765443,2014-10-11 16:46:06,Shoot the hostage.

520933363536760834,2014-10-11 13:46:07,"Well, what's to like?"
520918265967554560,2014-10-11 12:46:07,I don't like it.
520903162530508800,2014-10-11 11:46:06,I don't recognize the work but he's a pro. He's cutting it close.
520888064114044929,2014-10-11 10:46:06,Anyone we know?
520872967652130817,2014-10-11 09:46:07,Looks pretty solid.
520857867910262785,2014-10-11 08:46:07,You're the expert. I just work here.
520842769346990080,2014-10-11 07:46:07,What do you think?
520827663464665088,2014-10-11 06:46:06,Makes no sense.
520812569896841217,2014-10-11 05:46:07,How come they sent cops here? Shouldn't they send repair guys?
520797468481429505,2014-10-11 04:46:07,We'll have you out of there as soon as possible. (Am I lying?)
520782369024790528,2014-10-11 03:46:07,"Hey, come on! What are you guys waiting for?"
520767266342703105,2014-10-11 02:46:06,There's been an elevator malfunction so just relax.

520737074123517952,2014-10-11 00:46:07,Thank God.

520570979030814720,2014-10-10 13:46:07,Looks like we're walking.
520555881839083520,2014-10-10 12:46:08,"Worthy, Briggs, I want you to secure the base area ‚Äî no one in or out. Everyone else I want you to affirm building evac. Move!"
520540781686190080,2014-10-10 11:46:08,The nearest access panel's on the 2nd floor in the lobby. I want reports only. We're in a holding pattern.
520525682573471745,2014-10-10 10:46:08,Fine. The two of you check it out.
520510586937806848,2014-10-10 09:46:09,"Yeah, right."
520495484398354434,2014-10-10 08:46:08,"Sir, Harry volunteers to examine the device."
520480388343275520,2014-10-10 07:46:09,The bomber's also wired the hatch to trigger the bomb which seats him in the ‚Äúcrazy but not stupid‚Äù section.
520465287586398208,2014-10-10 06:46:09,This is an express elevator. The only way in or out is through access panels.
520450186611396608,2014-10-10 05:46:08,We can't just unload the passengers?
520435087414816768,2014-10-10 04:46:08,"The city would like to avoid that event, Officer Traven."
520419991452008449,2014-10-10 03:46:09,"Yeah, the basement."
520404886970580992,2014-10-10 02:46:08,Anything else that'll keep this elevator from falling?
520389788004675586,2014-10-10 01:46:08,That leaves us 23 minutes exactly.
520374686757040128,2014-10-10 00:46:08,He gave one hour.
520359589804392448,2014-10-09 23:46:08,What's our clock?
520344492990144512,2014-10-09 22:46:09,The bomber wants $3 million or he blows the emergency brakes.
520329393210552321,2014-10-09 21:46:09,"Alright gentlemen, what we have here are 13 passengers in an express elevator... below floor 30. Bomb's already taken out cables."
520299190782418944,2014-10-09 19:46:08,"Now, there's no other way ‚Äî no doors ‚Äî no other way in or out except through access panels, is that correct?"
520284097004855296,2014-10-09 18:46:09,"Yes, sir."
520268997434937345,2014-10-09 17:46:09,"Mr. Bagwell, make sure these other elevators remain locked down and empty."

519166749678112769,2014-10-06 16:46:13,"Oh, God."
519151650812866560,2014-10-06 15:46:13,He lost his head.

518653381951246337,2014-10-05 06:46:17,"Wouldn't be able to interest you in a bribe, would I?"
518638278451269632,2014-10-05 05:46:16,He is so persistent. He always gets his man.
518623181548969985,2014-10-05 04:46:16,"Hey, Jack, is that you?"

518532585635332097,2014-10-04 22:46:16,When you explode that's where they'll come but it's not where I'll be.
518517482530037760,2014-10-04 21:46:16,"This stick, huh? Works on a remote."
518502386772365313,2014-10-04 20:46:16,Just throw me off the train. I don't care.

517747424614301696,2014-10-02 18:46:19,"Oh, no. Poor people are crazy, Jack. I'm eccentric."
517732326386581504,2014-10-02 17:46:20,You're fucking crazy.
517717222874025984,2014-10-02 16:46:19,You're crazy.
517702123731943427,2014-10-02 15:46:19,"It is a cheap gold watch, buddy."
517687031309148160,2014-10-02 14:46:21,"Do you know what a bomb is, Jack, that doesn't explode?"
517671926542520320,2014-10-02 13:46:19,Your life is empty because you spend it trying to stop the bomb from becoming. And for who? For what?
517656829224960000,2014-10-02 12:46:20,"That's its meaning, its purpose."
517641734142963712,2014-10-02 11:46:21,A bomb is made to explode.
517626634271084545,2014-10-02 10:46:21,Huh? The beauty of it.
517611534113976320,2014-10-02 09:46:21,"You still don't get it, do you Jack?"
517596429263437824,2014-10-02 08:46:19,I'll let go. Oh yeah.
517581333950779392,2014-10-02 07:46:20,Stay right there. I'll do it. I'll let go.
517566233185497089,2014-10-02 06:46:20,"C'mon, just take your goddamn money and walk!"
517551138606809090,2014-10-02 05:46:21,Just take it and walk. You don't need her.
517536040504942592,2014-10-02 04:46:22,Take it and walk. Come on.
517520937340510208,2014-10-02 03:46:21,Let her go. You don't need her. You have the money.
517505837934186497,2014-10-02 02:46:21,"Well, I think Harry would be very disappointed feeling that we're right back where we started, huh."
517490734438440960,2014-10-02 01:46:20,Now.
517475641055129602,2014-10-02 00:46:21,Fill it.
517460537324486658,2014-10-01 23:46:20,"No, I don't think I'm gonna do that."
517445439985971200,2014-10-01 22:46:21,Let her go.
517430345059147776,2014-10-01 21:46:22,I don't think you can shoot her.
517415241093636096,2014-10-01 20:46:21,"What are you gonna do, Jack?"
517400146980511744,2014-10-01 19:46:22,Be prepared! It's the Boy Scout marching song.
517385042830446592,2014-10-01 18:46:21,I'm sorry.
517369941125632001,2014-10-01 17:46:20,"Oh, no."
517354844584022016,2014-10-01 16:46:21,Turn around!!!

517309544490233857,2014-10-01 13:46:21,You have a hair trigger aimed at your head. What do you do?
517294449588596739,2014-10-01 12:46:22,"Pop quiz, asshole."
517279352614969345,2014-10-01 11:46:22,Freeze!
517264246384521216,2014-10-01 10:46:21,Shit!
517249149243109376,2014-10-01 09:46:21,Jack!
517234052227543040,2014-10-01 08:46:22,"Shit, it's moving! He's got the money!"
517218953358110720,2014-10-01 07:46:22,Just do it.
517203855533031425,2014-10-01 06:46:23,What for? It hasn't moved.
517188749751373824,2014-10-01 05:46:21,Turn it on.
517173654090559488,2014-10-01 04:46:22,I'd say he's covered.
517158556575862784,2014-10-01 03:46:22,"We got 200 eyes on that can, a bird dog in the bag."
517143455965790208,2014-10-01 02:46:22,"Well, that money hasn't moved."
517128357079547904,2014-10-01 01:46:22,He's never late.
517113256721121280,2014-10-01 00:46:22,What?
517098156769566720,2014-09-30 23:46:22,He's not late.
517083060139868160,2014-09-30 22:46:23,He's running a little late.
517067961194909696,2014-09-30 21:46:23,Just move right over here.
517052857577517056,2014-09-30 20:46:22,"Jack Traven, yes, he asked that you be brought out of harm's way."
517037758720647168,2014-09-30 19:46:22,"Oh, no. Jack Traven said..."
517022662615650304,2014-09-30 18:46:23,You can't be this close. You need to move back.
517007567055503360,2014-09-30 17:46:24,Hmm?
516992465669091329,2014-09-30 16:46:23,Miss.

516916967265955841,2014-09-30 11:46:23,üì∫ ...potentially a disastrous situation.
516901872943132673,2014-09-30 10:46:24,üì∫ Reports are that the bus continues to circle inside LAX.
516886770948911104,2014-09-30 09:46:24,üì∫ We still have no live picture.
516871667868381184,2014-09-30 08:46:23,üì∫ We'll report across the landing field when we're set up.
516856573251964929,2014-09-30 07:46:24,üì∫ The SWAT van followed the bus to the airport.
516841474437042176,2014-09-30 06:46:24,"Too bad, Jack. You could've made a good cop."
516826369955610624,2014-09-30 05:46:23,"It's done, sir."
516811275733458944,2014-09-30 04:46:24,"Norwood, are you sure the paint bomb is in with the money?"
516796169842728960,2014-09-30 03:46:23,Let's move it.
516781076891463680,2014-09-30 02:46:24,I want you in 4-1. You in 1-2. You're in 3
516765973127262208,2014-09-30 01:46:23,"Yes, sir!"
516750874530414593,2014-09-30 00:46:23,"Alright, here's our target. Fox!"

516720675214471168,2014-09-29 22:46:23,30 minutes.
516705581109747713,2014-09-29 21:46:25,He doesn't know it blew up.
516690477802733568,2014-09-29 20:46:24,Son of a bitch. I'll tell him what he can do with his goddamn money.
516675382742122497,2014-09-29 19:46:25,He wants to know when he's gonna get his money.
516660283687723008,2014-09-29 18:46:25,It's him.
516645181378945024,2014-09-29 17:46:24,Lieutenant!
516630084195581952,2014-09-29 16:46:25,We're going to take you guys back and have you checked out.
516614982792798208,2014-09-29 15:46:24,Sorry.
516599881494839296,2014-09-29 14:46:24,Ow! Watch it.
516584783069990914,2014-09-29 13:46:24,This should take care of it.
516569689296609280,2014-09-29 12:46:25,Okay.
516554590137769985,2014-09-29 11:46:26,How you doing?
516539484628717568,2014-09-29 10:46:24,"Annie, meet Lieutenant McMahon."
516524388087103489,2014-09-29 09:46:25,"Mac, this is Annie."
516509288462700544,2014-09-29 08:46:25,"Oh, boy."
516494190104936449,2014-09-29 07:46:25,I just might be a nice guy and let you have the rest of the day off.
516479088538578946,2014-09-29 06:46:25,We're okay.
516463992122798081,2014-09-29 05:46:25,How ya doing?
516448892695887873,2014-09-29 04:46:25,Here comes the cavalry.
516433796258742272,2014-09-29 03:46:26,Yeah. They've done extensive studying on this.
516418693710888960,2014-09-29 02:46:25,"Oh, yeah?"
516403594342309889,2014-09-29 01:46:25,"I hope not cause, you know, relationships that start under intense circumstances, they never last."
516388500518612993,2014-09-29 00:46:27,Maybe. I think I might.
516373397106741248,2014-09-28 23:46:26,You're not going to get mushy on me are you?
516358299592052736,2014-09-28 22:46:26,"Ugh, I hate the airport."
516343197039992832,2014-09-28 21:46:26,You did it.
516328100682940416,2014-09-28 20:46:26,"It's over, Annie. You did it."
516312999926059008,2014-09-28 19:46:26,It's okay. It's over.
516297903552212993,2014-09-28 18:46:27,It's okay.
516282801297977344,2014-09-28 17:46:26,No.
516267701841326080,2014-09-28 16:46:26,Are you alright?
516237503997571073,2014-09-28 14:46:26,Hold on.
516222406222819328,2014-09-28 13:46:27,Shit!
516207304459288577,2014-09-28 12:46:26,Jack.

516162003191070721,2014-09-28 09:46:26,Shit.
516146911011553280,2014-09-28 08:46:27,"Jack, I can't do this."
516131807507394561,2014-09-28 07:46:26,Oh God. I can't do this.
516116705513189376,2014-09-28 06:46:26,Okay. Annie get on.
516101613451096064,2014-09-28 05:46:28,I got it. Okay.
516086512455147520,2014-09-28 04:46:27,Yeah.
516071410599358465,2014-09-28 03:46:27,You got it?
516056312967217152,2014-09-28 02:46:27,"Okay, I got it."
516041213099528192,2014-09-28 01:46:27,Wedge down the gas pedal.
516026116549533696,2014-09-28 00:46:28,Aw God.
516011014165250048,2014-09-27 23:46:27,Hold it!
515995915736186882,2014-09-27 22:46:27,"Jack! No, no! No!"
515980818615762944,2014-09-27 21:46:28,Annie! You... hold on!
515965717225566209,2014-09-27 20:46:27,"Jack. Jack, I can't hold this any more."
515920417156911106,2014-09-27 17:46:27,Jack!
515905315800240128,2014-09-27 16:46:27,Shit!
515890223037685760,2014-09-27 15:46:28,Don't look down.
515875120913465344,2014-09-27 14:46:27,I gotcha.
515860025575628801,2014-09-27 13:46:28,Grab my hand!
515844926332878849,2014-09-27 12:46:29,Hold on. Hold on.
515829822879064064,2014-09-27 11:46:28,Give me your hand. Your hand.
515814722755493891,2014-09-27 10:46:27,"Come on, buddy. I got ya."
515799628680163328,2014-09-27 09:46:29,Let's go.
515784528216858624,2014-09-27 08:46:29,That's it. Come on.
515769428395298816,2014-09-27 07:46:28,Take his hand.
515754329987244034,2014-09-27 06:46:29,Grab my wrist.
515739228240482305,2014-09-27 05:46:28,üöåüèÉüèÉüèÉüöåüí£
515724130256052225,2014-09-27 04:46:29,That's good. That's good.
515693927265886208,2014-09-27 02:46:28,It's OK.
515663734585294850,2014-09-27 00:46:29,üì∫ The bomber snuck in here late last night.
515648633572569088,2014-09-26 23:46:29,Come on.
515633534203998208,2014-09-26 22:46:29,Come on! Look straight ahead.
515618436278259713,2014-09-26 21:46:29,Grab my wrist. That's it. Good.
515603336813236224,2014-09-26 20:46:29,üì∫ Police have just issued a general statement which really doesn't tell us much more.
515588235850817536,2014-09-26 19:46:29,"You, you, and you."
515573138394841088,2014-09-26 18:46:29,Okay.
515558039328260097,2014-09-26 17:46:29,"Alright, let's get them off."
515542935006228481,2014-09-26 16:46:28,Rig the steering wheel and the gas pedal.
515527839366381568,2014-09-26 15:46:29,üì∫ Certainly a sense of community.
515512738412384256,2014-09-26 14:46:29,üì∫ Hard to imagine what's going through their thoughts at this time.
515497637680668673,2014-09-26 13:46:28,üì∫ Everyone is safe for the moment.
515482543676600321,2014-09-26 12:46:30,üì∫ We still have no live picture but reports are that the bus continues to circle inside LAX...
515467439505539072,2014-09-26 11:46:29,Alright. Tape's. Rolling. üëè
515452346097082368,2014-09-26 10:46:30,Alright run it. Run it!
515437240864878592,2014-09-26 09:46:29,"I want you to make a tape and loop it so that it runs over and over, okay?"
515422144444895233,2014-09-26 08:46:29,Do it now.
515407047777468416,2014-09-26 07:46:30,I only have a minute of tape.
515391946026545152,2014-09-26 06:46:30,We have to unload.
515376850122448896,2014-09-26 05:46:30,Not enough time. Run the tape.
515361750120534017,2014-09-26 04:46:30,"Jack, five minutes."
515346652161253376,2014-09-26 03:46:31,Mac. Fuel.
515331553132441600,2014-09-26 02:46:31,Look.
515316453155676160,2014-09-26 01:46:31,Yeah?
515301347785068544,2014-09-26 00:46:29,Jack.
515286253458042881,2014-09-25 23:46:31,It's taping!
515271151178620928,2014-09-25 22:46:30,Tape it. Good. Come on. Tape it.
515165460476596224,2014-09-25 15:46:31,There's a signal going to that bus. I want you to find it.
515150359266729984,2014-09-25 14:46:31,"Yeah, sure."
515135261785616386,2014-09-25 13:46:31,"Now, you can broadcast UHF, right?"
515120162614157313,2014-09-25 12:46:31,LAPD. I need this unit.
515105064378064896,2014-09-25 11:46:32,Get those cameras to stop taping.
515089965273726977,2014-09-25 10:46:32,Is that news van still around?
515074865473155072,2014-09-25 09:46:32,"Yeah, I know about Harry."
515059763827048448,2014-09-25 08:46:31,It's Jack.
515044667709083650,2014-09-25 07:46:32,"Don't make any big movements, okay?"
515029560891416576,2014-09-25 06:46:30,I want you to stare straight ahead.
515014461313122304,2014-09-25 05:46:30,There's a camera on the bus just over my left shoulder.
514999364989636609,2014-09-25 04:46:31,The whim of a madman! I like that!
514984269106520064,2014-09-25 03:46:32,üì∫ ..held hostage at the whim of a mad man.
514969167171051520,2014-09-25 02:46:31,üì∫ The other people in jeopardy are of course the passengers of the bus...
514954071426342912,2014-09-25 01:46:32,üì∫ ..of another bus both blown up by the bomber.
514938970740781056,2014-09-25 00:46:32,üì∫ The two dead are a female passenger and the driver...
514923870877282304,2014-09-24 23:46:32,üì∫ ..races around literally in circles at the Los Angeles airport.
514908771764539392,2014-09-24 22:46:32,üì∫ A city bus rigged to explode if it slows down...
514893670160400385,2014-09-24 21:46:31,Doesn't look like it. He's just watching.
514878571899129856,2014-09-24 20:46:32,"Well, he -- he can see me but can he hear me?"
514863473948250113,2014-09-24 19:46:32,He's been playing me from minute one.
514848377410822145,2014-09-24 18:46:33,He can see the whole bus.
514833277891256321,2014-09-24 17:46:33,Bastard's got a camera right in your face.
514818177520238592,2014-09-24 16:46:33,He called you a wildcat before. I didn't even pick up on it.
514803079074443264,2014-09-24 15:46:33,Just keep looking straight ahead.
514787980922191872,2014-09-24 14:46:33,He can see you.
514772874440093696,2014-09-24 13:46:31,What?
514742682694856704,2014-09-24 11:46:33,Right.
514727581908627458,2014-09-24 10:46:33,Arizona Wildcats.
514712484926603264,2014-09-24 09:46:33,I don't really know.
514697381913169920,2014-09-24 08:46:33,"Yeah, I guess so."
514682286634442752,2014-09-24 07:46:34,Good football team.
514667185654865920,2014-09-24 06:46:33,Yeah? So?
514652085007028224,2014-09-24 05:46:33,Did you go to the University of Arizona?
514636983092531200,2014-09-24 04:46:32,I'll be damned.
514621888618700803,2014-09-24 03:46:34,"No, we're not. We got this far okay?"
514606788449009665,2014-09-24 02:46:33,We're going to die.
514591686027010048,2014-09-24 01:46:33,Alright?
514576588113846273,2014-09-24 00:46:33,Please?
514561488493621249,2014-09-23 23:46:33,Okay?
514546388957270016,2014-09-23 22:46:33,"Jack, please."
514531294462484481,2014-09-23 21:46:34,I can't do this by myself. Please?
514516193571385345,2014-09-23 20:46:34,"Okay, we're really scared and we need you right now, alright?"
514501095700594688,2014-09-23 19:46:34,"Stop it, okay? Don't give up on me right now, alright?"
514485991592431617,2014-09-23 18:46:33,"Jack, stop it! Jack come on!"
514470890549960704,2014-09-23 17:46:33,Don't give up on me!
514455797825146880,2014-09-23 16:46:34,Damn him! Damn it!
514440691015884800,2014-09-23 15:46:33,Damn it!
514425598400155649,2014-09-23 14:46:34,Jack.
514410497462919168,2014-09-23 13:46:34,It's getting on to 11AM Jack and I think it's going to be a very pretty day. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
514395397557469184,2014-09-23 12:46:34,I don't show until all your people are gone.
514380300453826560,2014-09-23 11:46:35,You drop the bags and leave.
514365200850362369,2014-09-23 10:46:34,There's a garbage can on the northeast corner.
514350104140980225,2014-09-23 09:46:35,You tell them that the drop point is Pershing Square.
514335001362440192,2014-09-23 08:46:34,Good.
514319904523030528,2014-09-23 07:46:35,Yeah.
514304802314928128,2014-09-23 06:46:34,Jack? Jack?
514289706213728256,2014-09-23 05:46:35,Jack are you listening to me?
514274605012226048,2014-09-23 04:46:35,Are you paying attention?
514259505383628800,2014-09-23 03:46:35,"Otherwise, you, the wildcat, and every innocent person on that bus are going to end up just like your friend."
514244407541764096,2014-09-23 02:46:35,You're going to pay me every dollar.
514229308110286849,2014-09-23 01:46:35,You can't beat me.
514214205004603392,2014-09-23 00:46:34,"Jack, we both know that he was the brains of your particular operation."
514199107477311488,2014-09-22 23:46:35,You're gonna do exactly as you're told.

513987720440336384,2014-09-22 09:46:36,"Norwood, get a fuel car out here on the double."
513972619415019520,2014-09-22 08:46:36,Gotcha.
513957519840903168,2014-09-22 07:46:36,I don't know. 10 minutes? It doesn't look good.
513942420656881664,2014-09-22 06:46:36,I'll see what I can find. How much time?
513927324811530241,2014-09-22 05:46:37,Can you get a fuel truck to pace us here? We're losing gas.

513866925663715328,2014-09-22 01:46:36,We are now.
513851829226971136,2014-09-22 00:46:37,We're leaking gas?

513821630011678721,2014-09-21 22:46:37,What is that smell?
513806530995421184,2014-09-21 21:46:37,Ow! Other than that I'm fine.

513066668981895168,2014-09-19 20:46:40,He's not back here.
513051568929660928,2014-09-19 19:46:40,What?
513036466214014977,2014-09-19 18:46:39,He's not behind us.
513021371828285441,2014-09-19 17:46:41,Can you see him?

512945872598880257,2014-09-19 12:46:40,Watch your back.
512930775868530690,2014-09-19 11:46:41,We're going to go after the source.
512915670372057088,2014-09-19 10:46:39,"Jack, I want you to get out of there and sit tight."
512900578045743104,2014-09-19 09:46:41,We can get to his place inside of 15 minutes.
512885479138525184,2014-09-19 08:46:41,"We got him. Jack, we found him."

512689187724603393,2014-09-18 19:46:42,"Yeah, I know. You're gonna have to cut off the sheath."
512674084367241216,2014-09-18 18:46:41,"Harry, it's covered."
512658988534484993,2014-09-18 17:46:42,"Jack, I'm gonna need you to look at the wire."
512643883746856960,2014-09-18 16:46:41,I'd use a fiber alloy.
512628786219597825,2014-09-18 15:46:41,That'd be too weak.

512538194512859137,2014-09-18 09:46:42,"Okay, we're gonna have to try to bypass the remote current with the battery."
512523094393499649,2014-09-18 08:46:42,This guy is nuts!
512507995066875904,2014-09-18 07:46:42,"Oh, thank you for the tip, Ortiz."
512492895429869568,2014-09-18 06:46:42,Just keep it steady.

512462700610215936,2014-09-18 04:46:43,"Have faith, sister."
512447596686626817,2014-09-18 03:46:42,This is not a very good plan.

512387202148339712,2014-09-17 23:46:43,What is he doing?
512372103400550401,2014-09-17 22:46:43,"Yeah. You be careful, Jack."
512357002417147906,2014-09-17 21:46:43,"Harry, you with me?"
512341906924109824,2014-09-17 20:46:44,"I just need a few minutes. If I can't do it by then, I can't do it at all."
512326806922211328,2014-09-17 19:46:44,We won't be able to hold this thing steady for very long.
512311705242988545,2014-09-17 18:46:43,I have no idea.
512296604406018048,2014-09-17 17:46:43,What is that?
512281502797672449,2014-09-17 16:46:42,"Hey, get your ass behind the yellow line."
512266410093858818,2014-09-17 15:46:44,"He didn't have to get on the bus in the first place, Ortiz."

512145611290734592,2014-09-17 07:46:43,"If we unload, he'll take them out, I guarantee."
512130515600543747,2014-09-17 06:46:44,He's been a step ahead every time.
512115415997095936,2014-09-17 05:46:44,"I don't know how, Mac. I just know he is."

512085219659112448,2014-09-17 03:46:45,No way. He's ready for that.
512070119388741632,2014-09-17 02:46:44,"The choppers are gone, Jack. Let's dump the passengers now."
512055017411317760,2014-09-17 01:46:44,Don't forget about us.
512039916604125184,2014-09-17 00:46:44,Hey.
512024823069818881,2014-09-16 23:46:45,Don't worry. I won't go far.
512009718953299968,2014-09-16 22:46:44,I would.
511994624903090176,2014-09-16 21:46:45,"What, are you just gonna leave us here?"
511979524917968897,2014-09-16 20:46:45,It'll be okay.
511964421338320896,2014-09-16 19:46:44,Do you think that's a good idea?
511949325212340225,2014-09-16 18:46:45,Everybody sit tight. I'm getting off for a minute.
511934226451529728,2014-09-16 17:46:45,Just keep circling. You'll be fine.
511919127192035329,2014-09-16 16:46:45,What?
511904022660251648,2014-09-16 15:46:44,He's letting me off.
511888923346231296,2014-09-16 14:46:44,Yeah?
511873827895144448,2014-09-16 13:46:45,Could be.
511858732242726913,2014-09-16 12:46:46,"So, I guess there's a plan now?"
511843631515189248,2014-09-16 11:46:46,Do not attempt to grow a brain.
511828530741526528,2014-09-16 10:46:45,You know that I'm on top of you.

511737931988340737,2014-09-16 04:46:45,You want the money I don't want anyone else to die.
511722833408311296,2014-09-16 03:46:45,They don't think that.
511707737382608896,2014-09-16 02:46:46,I need to talk to these people face to face. They think you're bullshit.
511692641424003072,2014-09-16 01:46:47,You want me to help you?
511677537211019264,2014-09-16 00:46:46,"Oh, no! That's not good."
511662440719724544,2014-09-15 23:46:46,You have to let me off.
511647336766775297,2014-09-15 22:46:45,"I got a medal, too, Jack. A medal and a pink slip and a ""sorry about your hand."""
511632237503066112,2014-09-15 21:46:45,I spent my life earning it.
511617138604265472,2014-09-15 20:46:45,"Oh, I earned it."
511602041257349120,2014-09-15 19:46:46,I know you want a shit load of money you didn't earn.
511586944124338176,2014-09-15 18:46:46,You don't even know me.
511571841706496000,2014-09-15 17:46:46,You don't know how I feel about this.
511556751049510912,2014-09-15 16:46:48,"Oh, that's unfair Jack."
511541646266077184,2014-09-15 15:46:47,Aren't you?
511526543487537152,2014-09-15 14:46:46,Do they think I'm doing this for fun?
511511447222747136,2014-09-15 13:46:47,Why are they messing with me?
511496345962561536,2014-09-15 12:46:46,"I hate negotiators, Jack. They talk to you like they're your best friend and they don't even know you."
511481248955375617,2014-09-15 11:46:47,Because I want you to help me to get it before it gets too late.
511466151025471489,2014-09-15 10:46:47,What are you telling me for?
511451051069681664,2014-09-15 09:46:47,Can you remember all that?
511435950409261056,2014-09-15 08:46:47,"I would like uh, large non-sequential bills in two clear plastic bags -- unmarked."
511420849526562816,2014-09-15 07:46:46,I wish that I had some loftier purpose but I'm afraid in the end it's just the money Jack.
511405755245666305,2014-09-15 06:46:48,I want money Jack.
511390648750989312,2014-09-15 05:46:46,What do you want?
511375555644493824,2014-09-15 04:46:48,But you've done alright for yourself.
511360452664635392,2014-09-15 03:46:47,"Some close calls, huh?"
511345355401592832,2014-09-15 02:46:47,"Very, very exciting Jack."
511330255525539840,2014-09-15 01:46:47,Yeah?
511315160154132480,2014-09-15 00:46:48,üì±‚òé
511300056658354176,2014-09-14 23:46:47,I already seen the airport.
511284957793095680,2014-09-14 22:46:47,Yeah? So?
511269855480131584,2014-09-14 21:46:47,We're at the airport.
511254758888206336,2014-09-14 20:46:47,"Yeah, let's hope it's built. Let's move!"
511239662325624832,2014-09-14 19:46:48,"That must be Bravo Tango, an emergency runway."
511224560172027904,2014-09-14 18:46:47,He's headed for the end of the field.
511209458018443264,2014-09-14 17:46:47,The choppers can't fly in there. It's restricted airspace.
511194364454764545,2014-09-14 16:46:48,He'll be able to circle the runways and buy us some time.
511179263886639104,2014-09-14 15:46:48,"That's my boy, Jack."
511164164086038528,2014-09-14 14:46:48,There's thousands of people there.
511149064767811587,2014-09-14 13:46:48,He's just entered the airport.
511133966519115776,2014-09-14 12:46:48,Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop!
511118866362011649,2014-09-14 11:46:48,Whoa!
511088671655591936,2014-09-14 09:46:49,Right here?
511073575432749059,2014-09-14 08:46:50,Yeah.
511058466073350144,2014-09-14 07:46:47,Where? Right here?
511043371675025408,2014-09-14 06:46:49,In there.
511028271220137984,2014-09-14 05:46:48,"Now, now. Get off this."
511013171683786753,2014-09-14 04:46:48,Get off this.
510998074294951938,2014-09-14 03:46:49,What?
510982970925010944,2014-09-14 02:46:48,Get off.
510967873510985729,2014-09-14 01:46:49,Ow.
510952772095590400,2014-09-14 00:46:48,Watch the road. You should have been a pilot.
510937677244276736,2014-09-13 23:46:49,Yeah? What was it?
510922576214761473,2014-09-13 22:46:49,I think you missed your calling.
510907476091219968,2014-09-13 21:46:49,Thank you. Thank you very much.
510892377322438656,2014-09-13 20:46:49,You are the man! You. Are. The. Man!
510877280202010624,2014-09-13 19:46:49,We made it.
510862177956139008,2014-09-13 18:46:49,We did it!
510816883637903361,2014-09-13 15:46:50,Is everybody okay?
510801785494056960,2014-09-13 14:46:50,Go on! Let's go!
510786679251034112,2014-09-13 13:46:48,Alright!
510771586316500992,2014-09-13 12:46:50,I'm okay.
510741386891501568,2014-09-13 10:46:50,Yeah.
510726289964007426,2014-09-13 09:46:51,You okay?
510711188695420929,2014-09-13 08:46:50,We are way out of control!
510696088806756352,2014-09-13 07:46:50,Yes!
510680989413040128,2014-09-13 06:46:50,________   üöå   ________
510665895476088832,2014-09-13 05:46:51,Shit!
510620587715080192,2014-09-13 02:46:49,"Oh, I want to see our baby."
510605492679229440,2014-09-13 01:46:50,Everybody hold on!
510590396817108992,2014-09-13 00:46:51,Oh shit.
510560190496645120,2014-09-12 22:46:49,Come on!
510545094789713921,2014-09-12 21:46:50,Oh God.
510529993630183425,2014-09-12 20:46:50,"Come on, come on."
510514897218592768,2014-09-12 19:46:51,Jack.
510499797124403200,2014-09-12 18:46:50,Yeah?
510484697420288000,2014-09-12 17:46:50,Jack!
510469599133839362,2014-09-12 16:46:51,Is this really going to work?
510454506526494721,2014-09-12 15:46:52,Hold on.
510439404158988288,2014-09-12 14:46:52,"Hey, I didn't mean to shoot the guy."
510424303121084416,2014-09-12 13:46:51,Put your bags underneath the seat.
510409201915412480,2014-09-12 12:46:51,"Let's put these underneath your seat, alright?"
510394100772634625,2014-09-12 11:46:50,That's all we can do.
510379002452652033,2014-09-12 10:46:51,That's it? That's it??
510363906854756352,2014-09-12 09:46:52,"When we hit the gap, heads down."
510348808538951680,2014-09-12 08:46:52,Everybody hold onto your seats or whatever you can.
510333709451423744,2014-09-12 07:46:52,Fine.
510318610112212992,2014-09-12 06:46:52,It's an interchange. There might be an incline. Floor it.
510303504137609216,2014-09-12 05:46:51,Floor it!
510288404999720960,2014-09-12 04:46:51,What?
510273311675129856,2014-09-12 03:46:52,Floor it.
510258210750472192,2014-09-12 02:46:52,What? Jack?
510243110790524928,2014-09-12 01:46:52,What then? What what?
510228014336987137,2014-09-12 00:46:52,"No, he'd have thought of that."
510212911256457216,2014-09-11 23:46:52,What if I shift into neutral and just keep the engine reving?
510197816421916672,2014-09-11 22:46:53,Jack.
510182713341382656,2014-09-11 21:46:52,Geez.
510167615914795009,2014-09-11 20:46:52,This is crazy.
510152518358159360,2014-09-11 19:46:53,50 feet a couple of miles ahead.
510137419878789120,2014-09-11 18:46:53,How big is a gap?
510122314977902592,2014-09-11 17:46:52,What do you mean?
510092117339668480,2014-09-11 15:46:52,There's a gap in the freeway.
510077022882631680,2014-09-11 14:46:53,What's the matter?
510061920091525123,2014-09-11 13:46:52,"Jack? Jack, what did he say?"
510046824749494272,2014-09-11 12:46:53,What did -- what did he say?
510031723472490496,2014-09-11 11:46:53,You know I can't.
510016618777178113,2014-09-11 10:46:52,"Jack, we got to get these people off the bus somehow."
510001520792727552,2014-09-11 09:46:52,What?
509986424511139841,2014-09-11 08:46:53,50 feet.
509971329785659392,2014-09-11 07:46:54,You're kidding. How big?
509956226860318721,2014-09-11 06:46:53,It's big.
509941123104514048,2014-09-11 05:46:52,There's a gap in the road up ahead.
509926025799561216,2014-09-11 04:46:53,50 feet. At least.
509910928033202177,2014-09-11 03:46:53,How big is the section?
509895832712122368,2014-09-11 02:46:54,Jack!
509880732328534016,2014-09-11 01:46:54,"Hey, get closer. Watch him in the mirror."
509865628300099584,2014-09-11 00:46:53,Get me closer!
509850534170198016,2014-09-10 23:46:54,You're fired. Everybody's fucking fired!
509835428166262785,2014-09-10 22:46:53,Fuck!
509820330332786688,2014-09-10 21:46:53,I guess they fell behind.
509805235829628928,2014-09-10 20:46:54,But it's on the map. It's finished on the goddamn map!
509790131788599296,2014-09-10 19:46:53,Section missing?
509775037155401728,2014-09-10 18:46:54,The aerial unit caught it. About 3 miles ahead. There's a section missing!
509759938193653760,2014-09-10 17:46:54,What are you talking about?
509744835259953153,2014-09-10 16:46:53,This freeway isn't finished!
509729734922489857,2014-09-10 15:46:53,What?
509714637177114624,2014-09-10 14:46:54,"Sir, we have a serious problem."
509699538832347136,2014-09-10 13:46:54,"Well, how far?!"
509684443271790592,2014-09-10 12:46:55,Are you sure?
509669339931230208,2014-09-10 11:46:54,üì±
509654239618932736,2014-09-10 10:46:54,Okay.
509639144302080000,2014-09-10 09:46:55,Big asshole.
509624041867444226,2014-09-10 08:46:54,"He's the asshole, Annie. The guy who put us here. Remember that."
509608946974199808,2014-09-10 07:46:55,"But, Annie, if she'd gotten off it would have killed us all."
509593843008696320,2014-09-10 06:46:54,She was scared. She was a nice lady who didn't deserve to get killed.
509578745204576256,2014-09-10 05:46:55,I know but she was so scared.
509563645433364480,2014-09-10 04:46:54,You should be glad. We all are. It doesn't mean you don't care.
509548550611419136,2014-09-10 03:46:56,Don't be.
509533446394216448,2014-09-10 02:46:54,I'm so sorry.
509518352457293825,2014-09-10 01:46:56,Mm-hmm.
509503249490006016,2014-09-10 00:46:55,You were glad you were still alive.
509488151488770048,2014-09-09 23:46:55,And when I saw her body fall under the bus it was like...
509473052250238976,2014-09-09 22:46:55,"I thought that was it. I thought that was the bomb. And I was dead."""
509457951124246528,2014-09-09 21:46:55,I know.
509442855094325248,2014-09-09 20:46:56,When that bomb went off...?
509427753418883072,2014-09-09 19:46:55,What can I do?
509412654234890240,2014-09-09 18:46:55,Mm-mm.
509397552437792768,2014-09-09 17:46:55,How are you doing? You alright?
509382456596635648,2014-09-09 16:46:56,Hey!
509367359811768320,2014-09-09 15:46:56,Why don't we just step outside!
509352260300574721,2014-09-09 14:46:56,"Oh, so you're a really tough guy huh? You're really tough, huh, Gigantor?"
509337158037929984,2014-09-09 13:46:56,Why don't you let everybody die in peace if that's what's gonna happen?
509322057872470016,2014-09-09 12:46:56,I think I have the right to be a little upset.
509306955953754112,2014-09-09 11:46:55,"Oh, yeah?"
509291863321214976,2014-09-09 10:46:57,He gets on everybody's nerves.
509276760433639424,2014-09-09 09:46:56,The guy's just talking crazy. He gets on my nerves.
509261663048982528,2014-09-09 08:46:56,"Hey, what are you talking about, man?"
509246565123256320,2014-09-09 07:46:57,"Hey! So, if you have a wife and I don't does that mean I'm expendable?"
509231461405188096,2014-09-09 06:46:56,"Oh, you do?"
509216362489602048,2014-09-09 05:46:56,"Hey, shut up man. I got a wife."
509201266946236416,2014-09-09 04:46:57,I mean for me to... I can't die here.

509171066590076928,2014-09-09 02:46:56,"Interactive TV, Jack. Wave of the future! Hahaha! Huh?"
509155966818861056,2014-09-09 01:46:56,üì∫ She was pulled under the wheels. This is terrible.
509140869312557056,2014-09-09 00:46:57,üì∫ A woman caught in the blast fell.
509125765963595776,2014-09-08 23:46:56,üì∫ The bus hasn't exploded but... oh my God.

508989878768394240,2014-09-08 14:46:58,"Come on, lady. Give me your hand."
508974776023412736,2014-09-08 13:46:57,He's going to be okay.
508959676747108352,2014-09-08 12:46:57,Yes!
508944580310347776,2014-09-08 11:46:58,Oh my God.

508899279767736321,2014-09-08 08:46:57,Stand clear!
508869080309174272,2014-09-08 06:46:57,I got him!
508853980185653248,2014-09-08 05:46:57,Hold it steady!
508838884029911041,2014-09-08 04:46:58,Okay Okay! Right there! Steady!
508823785563099136,2014-09-08 03:46:58,A little more!
508808686119026689,2014-09-08 02:46:58,Let's try it one more time.
508793584242278401,2014-09-08 01:46:58,"Okay, Annie. No problem."
508778490053656576,2014-09-08 00:46:59,Sorry! Sorry.

508748289106128896,2014-09-07 22:46:58,"Okay, how's this?"
508733185396449280,2014-09-07 21:46:57,Okay.
508718089182007296,2014-09-07 20:46:58,"Annie, a little closer!"
508702990765535232,2014-09-07 19:46:58,"A little closer, Annie!"
508687888502910976,2014-09-07 18:46:58,Closer!
508672793257340928,2014-09-07 17:46:59,Alright.
508657701555933184,2014-09-07 16:47:01,Okay?
508642590321688576,2014-09-07 15:46:58,"Okay, Annie, get as close as you can."
508627493222236160,2014-09-07 14:46:58,Drive straight! Keep it straight!
508612396248625152,2014-09-07 13:46:59,"Okay, Annie."
508597297811185664,2014-09-07 12:46:59,Take care Sam.
508582195993116674,2014-09-07 11:46:59,Like I've been shot.
508567099346677760,2014-09-07 10:46:59,How are you feeling?
508551999885815809,2014-09-07 09:46:59,I can't stay! I can't stay.
508536894775242752,2014-09-07 08:46:58,"Hey, hey, hey, lady! I've got you."
508521800938954752,2014-09-07 07:46:59,What about the rest of us???
508506702602199040,2014-09-07 06:47:00,What about the rest of us?
508491604097634304,2014-09-07 05:47:00,Keep him straight or I think the wound will tear.
508476500731899904,2014-09-07 04:46:59,I need you to pass him to me.
508461404890750977,2014-09-07 03:47:00,"Ortiz, I'm gonna to need your help."
508446305601871874,2014-09-07 02:47:00,Ortiz.
508431207193780224,2014-09-07 01:47:00,Gigantor!
508416108689256448,2014-09-07 00:47:00,For now.
508401005768085504,2014-09-06 23:47:00,Just him?
508385910157615105,2014-09-06 22:47:00,We're going to get the bus driver off.
508370806569570304,2014-09-06 21:47:00,Get us closer!
508355708547375104,2014-09-06 20:47:00,Norwood!
508340610055430145,2014-09-06 19:47:00,He's letting us unload the driver.
508325507864084480,2014-09-06 18:46:59,And Jack -- don't slip.
508310408172544000,2014-09-06 17:46:59,You tell that wildcat behind the wheel not to slow down though or he won't even get a chance to bleed to death.
508295313040228352,2014-09-06 16:47:00,"Okay, son. You can try and unload the driver."
508280211767443456,2014-09-06 15:47:00,There's still gonna be plenty of us to kill.
508265112331763713,2014-09-06 14:47:00,It'll grease the wheels with the money men if you show a little charity.
508250013751717888,2014-09-06 13:47:00,No one gets off.
508234912596361216,2014-09-06 12:47:00,This man has no time.
508219814666440704,2014-09-06 11:47:00,I thought it was customary for a police officer to shoot the bad guys.
508204715796992002,2014-09-06 10:47:00,"Jack, tell me that you haven't been shooting the passengers."
508189613731479555,2014-09-06 09:47:00,As an act of faith. We have an injured man here. The driver's been shot.
508174517718372352,2014-09-06 08:47:01,We went over the rules.
508159415749316608,2014-09-06 07:47:00,"Look, you've got to let me have one."
508144318914113536,2014-09-06 06:47:01,I think we have trust but it looks on TV like you're trying to get those passengers off the bus.
508129217087680513,2014-09-06 05:47:00,Yeah?
508114121401704448,2014-09-06 04:47:01,"I mean, you know."
508099017939505152,2014-09-06 03:47:00,"Sure they are. They're the police. Hey, your taxes are paying their salary. If we die they got to take a pay cut."
508083925063712768,2014-09-06 02:47:02,Are they going to help us?
508068824604610560,2014-09-06 01:47:01,The bleeding is less but...
508053719913480192,2014-09-06 00:47:00,How's he doing?
508038627033497600,2014-09-05 23:47:02,Give him the number!
508023525018308608,2014-09-05 22:47:01,OK give him the number.
508008425775579136,2014-09-05 21:47:01,He's on the line for you.
507993327262646273,2014-09-05 20:47:01,Lieutenant? It's him! He wants to talk to Jack!
507978230964297728,2014-09-05 19:47:02,Harry's trying to find out who this guy is. We think maybe he's a cop.
507963128248668160,2014-09-05 18:47:01,Remember -- crazy not stupid!
507948030461345792,2014-09-05 17:47:02,I got orders! We move these people he'll see!
507932932762124288,2014-09-05 16:47:02,We got to get these people out of harm's way!
507917829182464000,2014-09-05 15:47:01,"There's no time for any stunts, Traven."
507902729734221824,2014-09-05 14:47:01,"We can't do it, sir!"
507887632831877121,2014-09-05 13:47:02,Let's get these passengers off the bus!
507872535589818368,2014-09-05 12:47:02,"Hey, Mac!"
507857434090549248,2014-09-05 11:47:02,Hey!
507842338043871233,2014-09-05 10:47:03,I've seen this asshole.
507827233596010496,2014-09-05 09:47:02,I want pictures!
507812135343120384,2014-09-05 08:47:02,He may not be LAPD but he's living here now.
507797039208353792,2014-09-05 07:47:03,This guy's drawing disability.
507781939084804096,2014-09-05 06:47:03,I want you to start going through the pension fund.
507766840227946496,2014-09-05 05:47:03,Forget the files.
507751736723775488,2014-09-05 04:47:02,I can't access all that.
507736638328303616,2014-09-05 03:47:02,He could be from anywhere.
507721540989771776,2014-09-05 02:47:03,No one's lost a thumb for at least the last 10 years.
507706438085398528,2014-09-05 01:47:02,We got no match for that description.
507691342948859904,2014-09-05 00:47:03,üòò
507676244024901632,2014-09-04 23:47:03,But I'm not available to drive tomorrow. Busy.
507661142026498048,2014-09-04 22:47:02,Then tomorrow we'll play another one.
507646045661044737,2014-09-04 21:47:03,What if you win?
507630943511662592,2014-09-04 20:47:02,"If he gets the money, he wins. If the bus blows up, he wins."
507615843035779072,2014-09-04 19:47:02,Nothing. It's a game.
507600747580518400,2014-09-04 18:47:03,What does that have to do with us?
507585645183647745,2014-09-04 17:47:02,A while back he held some people for ransom. It went sour and now he's a little pissed at me.
507570549833224192,2014-09-04 16:47:03,"So, um, what is this guy's deal?"
507555446454898688,2014-09-04 15:47:03,I don't buy that. It's not a very good way to make money.
507540349846183936,2014-09-04 14:47:03,"No, it's just a guy who wants money."
507525247881318400,2014-09-04 13:47:03,I mean what did we do? Bomb the guy's country or something?
507510153495584768,2014-09-04 12:47:04,"So, why is all this happening?"
507495048296947713,2014-09-04 11:47:02,Okay.
507479952682258432,2014-09-04 10:47:03,As opposed to ma'am?
507449752175144961,2014-09-04 08:47:03,It's my name. Annie.
507434652148068352,2014-09-04 07:47:03,What?
507419552536199168,2014-09-04 06:47:03,Annie.
507404457986887681,2014-09-04 05:47:04,"Ma'am, you did very well. Actually, you were incredible. I've never seen driving like that."
507389356781215745,2014-09-04 04:47:04,Hold the wheel? Thank you.
507374260537421824,2014-09-04 03:47:04,Could you do me a favor and hold the wheel for me for a second?
507359162603302912,2014-09-04 02:47:05,Shoot.
507344058235113473,2014-09-04 01:47:04,We have a window here. I want to make sure it stays open.
507328961550905344,2014-09-04 00:47:04,"Norwood, I want aerial units up ahead. No obstructions in the freeway."
507313860966371329,2014-09-03 23:47:04,Okay.
507298765493911552,2014-09-03 22:47:05,"Frank, get rid of that scaffolding and replace it with webbing."
507283665399713794,2014-09-03 21:47:05,Hurry up!
507268563795599360,2014-09-03 20:47:04,Hold it right there!
507253466209607680,2014-09-03 19:47:05,If you need to you go right ahead and vomit.
507238368929787904,2014-09-03 18:47:05,It's okay.
507223267455664129,2014-09-03 17:47:05,I can't think.
507208163708248064,2014-09-03 16:47:04,Oh my God. We might've died.
507193063198834688,2014-09-03 15:47:04,üöÅ Take me to that interchange at the 105.

506921283179642880,2014-09-02 21:47:06,Oh God. We're going to tip over.
506906184364720128,2014-09-02 20:47:06,You can make it. Keep left. Keep left and you make it wide.
506891083171631104,2014-09-02 19:47:06,I can't make that turn.
506875982154719234,2014-09-02 18:47:06,There's a turn.
506860881079054336,2014-09-02 17:47:05,That's a dead end.
506845788354248704,2014-09-02 16:47:07,This should be it.
506830688557867010,2014-09-02 15:47:07,We got a hard right coming up at the construction site.
506815589709393922,2014-09-02 14:47:07,What's ugly?
506800490324037633,2014-09-02 13:47:07,How ugly?

506619296286388224,2014-09-02 01:47:07,There was no baby. It was full of cans.
506604199556034561,2014-09-02 00:47:08,Cans!!
506589100195860480,2014-09-01 23:47:08,I just hit the baby!

506438103448289280,2014-09-01 13:47:07,"In a few blocks, we'll take a soft turn to the right."
506423005577084928,2014-09-01 12:47:08,Got it.
506407908339224576,2014-09-01 11:47:08,It's not in use. It'll be empty. You'll be totally clear.
506392812917506048,2014-09-01 10:47:09,They're gonna lead you to the 105 Freeway.
506377712387121152,2014-09-01 09:47:09,A few more blocks you'll come up to a soft turn ‚Äî right. Then hold straight. I've got some units waiting for you there.

506181419547115521,2014-08-31 20:47:09,I can see you. Just keep going straight.
506166318031048704,2014-08-31 19:47:08,I had to bail on the freeway. We're in the city.

506136119764062209,2014-08-31 17:47:09,Come on. Let's go.
506121025285652480,2014-08-31 16:47:10,No. I want to look at cops.
506105922620375040,2014-08-31 15:47:09,We did the mug shots already. It's not gonna help.
506090827672588291,2014-08-31 14:47:10,I want to look at the files for the last 10 years.
506075727079297024,2014-08-31 13:47:10,Wait a minute.
506060628369235968,2014-08-31 12:47:10,"Yeah, and everything we'd do to dismantle it."
506045522990202880,2014-08-31 11:47:09,He's an encyclopedia of bombs and knows every kind.
506030428403167232,2014-08-31 10:47:10,"This guy uses C4, dynamite, different trigger every time, and now he throws in this watch."
506015327562366977,2014-08-31 09:47:10,A bomber falls in love with one kind of bomb and they're very monogamous.
506000232673325058,2014-08-31 08:47:11,This guy has no M.O.
505985129873801217,2014-08-31 07:47:10,"Lots of people have watches, Harry."
505970026478727169,2014-08-31 06:47:09,The watch is a shitty timer. Why use it? What's he saying?
505954929450577920,2014-08-31 05:47:10,I don't get it.

505864336204521472,2014-08-30 23:47:10,This is much better.
505849238652071936,2014-08-30 22:47:11,"Ow, my foot!"
505834134762057728,2014-08-30 21:47:10,Go! Go!
505819038165905408,2014-08-30 20:47:11,It's red!

505698242122641408,2014-08-30 12:47:11,Watch it! Watch it!
505683144813473792,2014-08-30 11:47:11,Okay.
505668042009763840,2014-08-30 10:47:10,Get on the shoulder.

505607651103760384,2014-08-30 06:47:12,Shit. What do I do?
505592551932301312,2014-08-30 05:47:12,"What's on your mind, Harry?"
505577451313840129,2014-08-30 04:47:12,Officer? Officer?!
505562349281890304,2014-08-30 03:47:11,Gold. Gold band. Fairly cheesy.
505547253197443074,2014-08-30 02:47:12,A watch? What kind of watch?
505532152918716417,2014-08-30 01:47:12,Three triggers. One on the axle I can't really see‚Ä¶ a cellular remote and a timer running off a wrist watch.
505501950893236224,2014-08-29 23:47:11,"Okay, alright. Just stay calm."
505486858592083968,2014-08-29 22:47:13,"Harry, there's enough C4 on this thing to put a hole in the world."
505471752361635840,2014-08-29 21:47:11,"O_______O oh, darn."
505456658173005824,2014-08-29 20:47:12,Fuck me!
505441558519230464,2014-08-29 19:47:12,Hold on..
505426458404077568,2014-08-29 18:47:12,Hold on.
505411361564659712,2014-08-29 17:47:13,What else??
505396258291195904,2014-08-29 16:47:12,What else?
505381159186862080,2014-08-29 15:47:12,That's your classic decoy.
505366062062260225,2014-08-29 14:47:13,"No! No, no! Don't do that. That's a decoy. Classic."
505350965281574913,2014-08-29 13:47:13,He can reach the circuit wire.
505335866605060097,2014-08-29 12:47:13,I think I can reach the circuit wire.
505320761922314240,2014-08-29 11:47:12,Brass fittings.
505305665535868929,2014-08-29 10:47:13,Brass fittings!
505290563273248769,2014-08-29 09:47:12,There's a pretty big wad.
505275465058115584,2014-08-29 08:47:13,Okay! We got a wad! Pretty big!
505260366964600832,2014-08-29 07:47:13,"Sir, take this. I want you to tell him what I see."
505245264785833984,2014-08-29 06:47:12,"Alright, Harry. We're in. Passenger relay."
505230170412707840,2014-08-29 05:47:14,"Access panel... in the floor... underneath you, man."
505215065306312704,2014-08-29 04:47:12,Hold on. Yes?
505199965858066433,2014-08-29 03:47:12,Excuse me! Excuse me!
505184870612488192,2014-08-29 02:47:13,"I can't get under the bus right now, Harry. It's kind of in motion."
505169774741970944,2014-08-29 01:47:14,Probably was rigged to one of the axles.
505154674974945280,2014-08-29 00:47:14,Then it's gonna be under the bus.
505139576122273792,2014-08-28 23:47:14,"No, it's clean."
505124470059589632,2014-08-28 22:47:13,"Excuse me, ma'am."
505109375757733888,2014-08-28 21:47:14,See any wires or anything?
505094277945241600,2014-08-28 20:47:14,Has it been fucked with? Or loosened? Or wires?
505079180422152192,2014-08-28 19:47:15,Check the speedometer.
505064077203238912,2014-08-28 18:47:14,Where do we start?

505033881339187200,2014-08-28 16:47:15,"Ah, would that be you, Jack?"
505018779747618816,2014-08-28 15:47:14,üì∫Minutes ago a Los Angeles police officer boarded the bus by jumping onto it from a moving car.
505003682094522369,2014-08-28 14:47:14,üì∫...at the Lincoln on-ramp. It began picking up speed swerving and hasn't slowed down since.
504988576786829313,2014-08-28 13:47:13,üì∫...has been driven off the road by the speeding bus. The bus apparently came onto the freeway...

504913081193861120,2014-08-28 08:47:14,Speeding?
504897987785789440,2014-08-28 07:47:15,What for?
504882885870895104,2014-08-28 06:47:14,"Well, I should probably tell you that I'm taking the bus because I had my driver's license revoked."
504867787886436352,2014-08-28 05:47:15,That's right.
504852688475926528,2014-08-28 04:47:15,"So you're a cop, right?"
504837590395015169,2014-08-28 03:47:15,Good plan.
504822492095995905,2014-08-28 02:47:15,Just for you to drive. We're okay for now. Just keep us above 50.
504807394484842496,2014-08-28 01:47:16,I'm fine. I'm fine. Just tell me what the plan is. Is there a plan???
504792293270761473,2014-08-28 00:47:15,I need to know! Can you handle this bus?
504777190622248960,2014-08-27 23:47:15,"Oh, sure. It's just like driving a really big Pinto."
504762093677998080,2014-08-27 22:47:15,"Miss, can you handle this bus?"
504746990228365312,2014-08-27 21:47:14,"Sam, lift your head."

502119729771724800,2014-08-20 15:47:27,You ruined a man's life's work and you think you can walk away?
502104627471319040,2014-08-20 14:47:26,You couldn't understand the kind of commitment that I have.
502089529486876672,2014-08-20 13:47:26,You think I wouldn't have been prepared? Two years I spent setting up that elevator job. Two years I invested myself in it.
502074433981251585,2014-08-20 12:47:27,Jesus!

499371673200521216,2014-08-13 01:47:39,We're not going to shoot them right?
499356569587310592,2014-08-13 00:47:38,Maybe we can do something about those hostages.
499341467148492800,2014-08-12 23:47:37,"Jack, come on."
499326372804694016,2014-08-12 22:47:38,This is taking way too long. How much you think that elevator weighs?

499235778388451328,2014-08-12 16:47:39,Take her out of the equation. Go for the good wound. He can't get to the plane with her. Clear shot.

499205577436721152,2014-08-12 14:47:39,Shoot the hostage.

499160282459951104,2014-08-12 11:47:39,"Well, what's to like?"
499145182781001728,2014-08-12 10:47:39,I don't like it.
499130082879762432,2014-08-12 09:47:39,I don't recognize the work but he's a pro. He's cutting it close.
499114979958587392,2014-08-12 08:47:38,Anyone we know?
499099886487216128,2014-08-12 07:47:40,Looks pretty solid.
499084785583521792,2014-08-12 06:47:40,You're the expert. I just work here.
499069680972075008,2014-08-12 05:47:38,What do you think?
499054585797824514,2014-08-12 04:47:39,Makes no sense.
499039486374735872,2014-08-12 03:47:39,How come they sent cops here? Shouldn't they send repair guys?
499024387731771392,2014-08-12 02:47:40,We'll have you out of there as soon as possible. (Am I lying?)
499009289394978816,2014-08-12 01:47:40,"Hey, come on! What are you guys waiting for?"
498994191465074688,2014-08-12 00:47:40,There's been an elevator malfunction so just relax.

498963987929632768,2014-08-11 22:47:39,Thank God.
498948889483804674,2014-08-11 21:47:39,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the LAPD."

498797895710031872,2014-08-11 11:47:40,Looks like we're walking.
498782797570375680,2014-08-11 10:47:40,"Worthy, Briggs, I want you to secure the base area ‚Äî no one in or out. Everyone else I want you to affirm building evac. Move!"
498767702593245184,2014-08-11 09:47:41,The nearest access panel's on the 2nd floor in the lobby. I want reports only. We're in a holding pattern.
498752601513414656,2014-08-11 08:47:41,Fine. The two of you check it out.
498737498965561344,2014-08-11 07:47:40,"Yeah, right."
498722402310705152,2014-08-11 06:47:41,"Sir, Harry volunteers to examine the device."
498707299339235328,2014-08-11 05:47:40,The bomber's also wired the hatch to trigger the bomb which seats him in the ‚Äúcrazy but not stupid‚Äù section.
498692203959418880,2014-08-11 04:47:41,This is an express elevator. The only way in or out is through access panels.
498677102632120320,2014-08-11 03:47:40,We can't just unload the passengers?
498662007080366080,2014-08-11 02:47:41,"The city would like to avoid that event, Officer Traven."
498646908580007936,2014-08-11 01:47:42,"Yeah, the basement."
498631805252034561,2014-08-11 00:47:41,Anything else that'll keep this elevator from falling?
498616711596093440,2014-08-10 23:47:42,That leaves us 23 minutes exactly.
498601606233870337,2014-08-10 22:47:41,He gave one hour.
498586509948116993,2014-08-10 21:47:41,What's our clock?
498571407828086784,2014-08-10 20:47:41,The bomber wants $3 million or he blows the emergency brakes.
498556312578306049,2014-08-10 19:47:42,"Alright gentlemen, what we have here are 13 passengers in an express elevator... below floor 30. Bomb's already taken out cables."
498526114378043392,2014-08-10 17:47:42,"Now, there's no other way ‚Äî no doors ‚Äî no other way in or out except through access panels, is that correct?"
498511010949365760,2014-08-10 16:47:41,"Yes, sir."
498495915976433664,2014-08-10 15:47:42,"Mr. Bagwell, make sure these other elevators remain locked down and empty."

496880301004443648,2014-08-06 04:47:50,"Wouldn't be able to interest you in a bribe, would I?"
496865198834057217,2014-08-06 03:47:49,He is so persistent. He always gets his man.
496850096114257920,2014-08-06 02:47:48,"Hey, Jack, is that you?"

496759507033141248,2014-08-05 20:47:50,When you explode that's where they'll come but it's not where I'll be.
496744403977764865,2014-08-05 19:47:49,"This stick, huh? Works on a remote."
496729301220196352,2014-08-05 18:47:48,Just throw me off the train. I don't care.

495974340437889025,2014-08-03 16:47:52,"Oh, no. Poor people are crazy, Jack. I'm eccentric."
495959242340188161,2014-08-03 15:47:52,You're fucking crazy.
495944144892612608,2014-08-03 14:47:53,You're crazy.
495929044710338560,2014-08-03 13:47:52,"It is a cheap gold watch, buddy."
495913948294569984,2014-08-03 12:47:53,"Do you know what a bomb is, Jack, that doesn't explode?"
495898851660689409,2014-08-03 11:47:54,Your life is empty because you spend it trying to stop the bomb from becoming. And for who? For what?
495883750509518848,2014-08-03 10:47:53,"That's its meaning, its purpose."
495868649614237696,2014-08-03 09:47:53,A bomb is made to explode.
495853553907277824,2014-08-03 08:47:54,Huh? The beauty of it.
495838451661430784,2014-08-03 07:47:53,"You still don't get it, do you Jack?"
495823353437880321,2014-08-03 06:47:54,I'll let go. Oh yeah.
495808248943890432,2014-08-03 05:47:52,Stay right there. I'll do it. I'll let go.
495793154608488448,2014-08-03 04:47:54,"C'mon, just take your goddamn money and walk!"
495778054178754560,2014-08-03 03:47:53,Just take it and walk. You don't need her.
495762953577066498,2014-08-03 02:47:53,Take it and walk. Come on.
495747856695697408,2014-08-03 01:47:54,Let her go. You don't need her. You have the money.
495732757515866112,2014-08-03 00:47:54,"Well, I think Harry would be very disappointed feeling that we're right back where we started, huh."
495717654364057601,2014-08-02 23:47:53,Now.
495702559449808896,2014-08-02 22:47:54,Fill it.
495687459066241024,2014-08-02 21:47:54,"No, I don't think I'm gonna do that."
495672356103143424,2014-08-02 20:47:53,Let her go.
495657257023967232,2014-08-02 19:47:53,I don't think you can shoot her.
495642156791365632,2014-08-02 18:47:53,"What are you gonna do, Jack?"
495627063953354754,2014-08-02 17:47:55,Be prepared! It's the Boy Scout marching song.
495611959648079872,2014-08-02 16:47:53,I'm sorry.
495596865685954561,2014-08-02 15:47:55,"Oh, no."
495581761686884354,2014-08-02 14:47:54,Turn around!!!
495566667284361216,2014-08-02 13:47:55,Turn around.

495536467720953856,2014-08-02 11:47:55,You have a hair trigger aimed at your head. What do you do?
495521364325851136,2014-08-02 10:47:54,"Pop quiz, asshole."
495506264072257536,2014-08-02 09:47:54,Freeze!
495491168377921536,2014-08-02 08:47:54,Shit!
495476069537820672,2014-08-02 07:47:55,Jack!
495460970458664960,2014-08-02 06:47:55,"Shit, it's moving! He's got the money!"
495445873468260352,2014-08-02 05:47:55,Just do it.
495430768802271232,2014-08-02 04:47:54,What for? It hasn't moved.
495415672449429504,2014-08-02 03:47:55,Turn it on.
495400573840015360,2014-08-02 02:47:55,I'd say he's covered.
495385473167007744,2014-08-02 01:47:55,"We got 200 eyes on that can, a bird dog in the bag."
495370373693595648,2014-08-02 00:47:55,"Well, that money hasn't moved."
495355277835644928,2014-08-01 23:47:56,He's never late.
495340176126640128,2014-08-01 22:47:55,What?
495325077454352384,2014-08-01 21:47:55,He's not late.
495309979805425664,2014-08-01 20:47:56,He's running a little late.
495294879660929024,2014-08-01 19:47:56,Just move right over here.
495279779478663168,2014-08-01 18:47:55,"Jack Traven, yes, he asked that you be brought out of harm's way."
495264676297867264,2014-08-01 17:47:55,"Oh, no. Jack Traven said..."
495249581253201920,2014-08-01 16:47:56,You can't be this close. You need to move back.
495234481146449920,2014-08-01 15:47:55,Hmm?
495219382805471233,2014-08-01 14:47:56,Miss.
495189181669203968,2014-08-01 12:47:55,No!

495158989705838593,2014-08-01 10:47:57,üì∫ ...and it's definitely been defused to some extent.
495143886663077888,2014-08-01 09:47:56,üì∫ ...potentially a disastrous situation.
495128790662520833,2014-08-01 08:47:57,üì∫ Reports are that the bus continues to circle inside LAX.
495113689364582400,2014-08-01 07:47:56,üì∫ We still have no live picture.
495098590134423552,2014-08-01 06:47:57,üì∫ We'll report across the landing field when we're set up.
495083491009105920,2014-08-01 05:47:57,üì∫ The SWAT van followed the bus to the airport.
495068387844710400,2014-08-01 04:47:56,"Too bad, Jack. You could've made a good cop."
495053293630918656,2014-08-01 03:47:57,"It's done, sir."
495038187945750530,2014-08-01 02:47:56,"Norwood, are you sure the paint bomb is in with the money?"
495023089403457537,2014-08-01 01:47:56,Let's move it.
495007990269759488,2014-08-01 00:47:56,I want you in 4-1. You in 1-2. You're in 3
494992894650888192,2014-07-31 23:47:57,"Yes, sir!"
494977797610168320,2014-07-31 22:47:57,"Alright, here's our target. Fox!"
494962695611752449,2014-07-31 21:47:57,I'll be right back.
494947594678722561,2014-07-31 20:47:56,30 minutes.
494932499407982592,2014-07-31 19:47:57,He doesn't know it blew up.
494917398005174272,2014-07-31 18:47:57,Son of a bitch. I'll tell him what he can do with his goddamn money.
494902295755120642,2014-07-31 17:47:56,He wants to know when he's gonna get his money.
494887199402229760,2014-07-31 16:47:57,It's him.

494736210812612610,2014-07-31 06:47:59,"Oh, boy."

494645611749068800,2014-07-31 00:47:58,"Oh, yeah?"
494630511671660544,2014-07-30 23:47:58,"I hope not cause, you know, relationships that start under intense circumstances, they never last."
494615413171294208,2014-07-30 22:47:58,Maybe. I think I might.
494600317082664961,2014-07-30 21:47:59,You're not going to get mushy on me are you?
494585211649130496,2014-07-30 20:47:58,"Ugh, I hate the airport."
494570119582855168,2014-07-30 19:47:59,You did it.
494555019018907648,2014-07-30 18:47:59,"It's over, Annie. You did it."
494539918224285697,2014-07-30 17:47:59,It's okay. It's over.
494524819094769664,2014-07-30 16:47:59,It's okay.
494509722930667520,2014-07-30 15:48:00,No.

494373824377270272,2014-07-30 06:47:59,"Jack, I can't do this."
494358729366573056,2014-07-30 05:48:00,Oh God. I can't do this.
494343627967954944,2014-07-30 04:48:00,Okay. Annie get on.

494268127295713281,2014-07-29 23:47:59,Wedge down the gas pedal.
494253031920107520,2014-07-29 22:48:00,Aw God.
494237934984232961,2014-07-29 21:48:00,Hold it!
494222834252541952,2014-07-29 20:48:00,"Jack! No, no! No!"

494147333638983681,2014-07-29 15:47:59,Jack!
494132235134455809,2014-07-29 14:48:00,Shit!
494117140039876609,2014-07-29 13:48:01,Don't look down.

494071841728626688,2014-07-29 10:48:01,Hold on. Hold on.
494056740413927426,2014-07-29 09:48:00,Give me your hand. Your hand.
494041643364798464,2014-07-29 08:48:01,"Come on, buddy. I got ya."
494026541454467072,2014-07-29 07:48:00,Let's go.
494011444921262080,2014-07-29 06:48:01,That's it. Come on.
493996345225527296,2014-07-29 05:48:01,Take his hand.
493981246817452033,2014-07-29 04:48:01,Grab my wrist.

493951049896853504,2014-07-29 02:48:02,That's good. That's good.
493920849041190912,2014-07-29 00:48:01,It's OK.
493890651570720771,2014-07-28 22:48:02,üì∫ The bomber snuck in here late last night.
493875551229063168,2014-07-28 21:48:01,Come on.
493860449255825409,2014-07-28 20:48:01,Come on! Look straight ahead.
493845354299666432,2014-07-28 19:48:02,Grab my wrist. That's it. Good.
493830252523565056,2014-07-28 18:48:01,üì∫ Police have just issued a general statement which really doesn't tell us much more.
493815152861380608,2014-07-28 17:48:01,"You, you, and you."
493800055548035072,2014-07-28 16:48:02,Okay.
493784957462904834,2014-07-28 15:48:02,"Alright, let's get them off."
493769858723487745,2014-07-28 14:48:02,Rig the steering wheel and the gas pedal.
493754761263325186,2014-07-28 13:48:03,üì∫ Certainly a sense of community.
493739654818979840,2014-07-28 12:48:01,üì∫ Hard to imagine what's going through their thoughts at this time.
493724558638071810,2014-07-28 11:48:02,üì∫ Everyone is safe for the moment.
493709459730857984,2014-07-28 10:48:02,üì∫ We still have no live picture but reports are that the bus continues to circle inside LAX...
493694357455638531,2014-07-28 09:48:01,Alright. Tape's. Rolling. üëè
493679259701874688,2014-07-28 08:48:02,Alright run it. Run it!
493664162375950336,2014-07-28 07:48:02,"I want you to make a tape and loop it so that it runs over and over, okay?"
493649061178654721,2014-07-28 06:48:02,Do it now.
493633967254290432,2014-07-28 05:48:03,I only have a minute of tape.
493618865817935872,2014-07-28 04:48:03,We have to unload.
493603763836309504,2014-07-28 03:48:02,Not enough time. Run the tape.
493588667768659969,2014-07-28 02:48:03,"Jack, five minutes."
493573569343787008,2014-07-28 01:48:03,Mac. Fuel.
493558467542532096,2014-07-28 00:48:03,Look.
493543370363392000,2014-07-27 23:48:03,Yeah?
493528269581320193,2014-07-27 22:48:03,Jack.
493513172469702656,2014-07-27 21:48:04,It's taping!
493498069493633026,2014-07-27 20:48:03,Tape it. Good. Come on. Tape it.
493482970678693888,2014-07-27 19:48:03,That ain't gonna be too hard.
493467870802632705,2014-07-27 18:48:03,Remember no big movements. Just look whipped.
493452778140737536,2014-07-27 17:48:04,Come on. Good! Tape off of that.
493437672312946690,2014-07-27 16:48:03,Come on.
493422578967396355,2014-07-27 15:48:04,"Please, sir‚â§ stop taping."
493407479095508992,2014-07-27 14:48:04,Emergency. We're going to have to take you off the air temporarily.
493392375398420480,2014-07-27 13:48:03,There's a signal going to that bus. I want you to find it.
493377279615975424,2014-07-27 12:48:04,"Yeah, sure."
493362179325038592,2014-07-27 11:48:04,"Now, you can broadcast UHF, right?"
493347078290948096,2014-07-27 10:48:04,LAPD. I need this unit.
493331977630527489,2014-07-27 09:48:03,Get those cameras to stop taping.
493316884108824577,2014-07-27 08:48:05,Is that news van still around?
493301781217026048,2014-07-27 07:48:04,"Yeah, I know about Harry."
493286685614931968,2014-07-27 06:48:05,It's Jack.
493271582471512064,2014-07-27 05:48:04,"Don't make any big movements, okay?"
493256484474466304,2014-07-27 04:48:04,I want you to stare straight ahead.
493241382035664898,2014-07-27 03:48:04,There's a camera on the bus just over my left shoulder.
493226286911721472,2014-07-27 02:48:05,The whim of a madman! I like that!
493211187467665409,2014-07-27 01:48:05,üì∫ ..held hostage at the whim of a mad man.
493196087205711872,2014-07-27 00:48:04,üì∫ The other people in jeopardy are of course the passengers of the bus...
493180991108677633,2014-07-26 23:48:05,üì∫ ..of another bus both blown up by the bomber.
493165887986233344,2014-07-26 22:48:04,üì∫ The two dead are a female passenger and the driver...
493150785648066560,2014-07-26 21:48:04,üì∫ ..races around literally in circles at the Los Angeles airport.
493135686522765312,2014-07-26 20:48:04,üì∫ A city bus rigged to explode if it slows down...
493120590232829952,2014-07-26 19:48:05,Doesn't look like it. He's just watching.
493105493485694977,2014-07-26 18:48:05,"Well, he -- he can see me but can he hear me?"
493090391902539777,2014-07-26 17:48:05,He's been playing me from minute one.
493075295818113025,2014-07-26 16:48:06,He can see the whole bus.
493060197980438530,2014-07-26 15:48:06,Bastard's got a camera right in your face.
493045095713603586,2014-07-26 14:48:05,He called you a wildcat before. I didn't even pick up on it.
493029997272391680,2014-07-26 13:48:06,Just keep looking straight ahead.
492999792549572608,2014-07-26 11:48:04,What?
492984694569304064,2014-07-26 10:48:05,He can see you.
492969598631677952,2014-07-26 09:48:05,Right.
492954502232694784,2014-07-26 08:48:06,Arizona Wildcats.
492939397495402496,2014-07-26 07:48:05,I don't really know.
492924300878708737,2014-07-26 06:48:06,"Yeah, I guess so."
492909201790754818,2014-07-26 05:48:06,Good football team.
492894101700743168,2014-07-26 04:48:06,Yeah? So?
492879005851201536,2014-07-26 03:48:06,Did you go to the University of Arizona?
492863907325702146,2014-07-26 02:48:07,I'll be damned.
492848801980239872,2014-07-26 01:48:05,"No, we're not. We got this far okay?"
492833704838852608,2014-07-26 00:48:06,We're going to die.
492818605860335616,2014-07-25 23:48:06,Alright?
492803502658170880,2014-07-25 22:48:05,Please?
492788410403147776,2014-07-25 21:48:07,Okay?
492773304847958016,2014-07-25 20:48:05,"Jack, please."
492758207522037760,2014-07-25 19:48:06,I can't do this by myself. Please?
492743109566951425,2014-07-25 18:48:06,"Okay, we're really scared and we need you right now, alright?"
492728010437447682,2014-07-25 17:48:06,"Stop it, okay? Don't give up on me right now, alright?"
492712911769309184,2014-07-25 16:48:06,"Jack, stop it! Jack come on!"
492697810710458369,2014-07-25 15:48:06,Don't give up on me!
492682714688917505,2014-07-25 14:48:07,Damn him! Damn it!
492667611247677440,2014-07-25 13:48:06,Damn it!
492652510566301697,2014-07-25 12:48:06,Jack.
492637417875054592,2014-07-25 11:48:07,It's getting on to 11AM Jack and I think it's going to be a very pretty day. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
492622316669390848,2014-07-25 10:48:07,I don't show until all your people are gone.
492607217644732417,2014-07-25 09:48:07,You drop the bags and leave.
492592120759201792,2014-07-25 08:48:08,There's a garbage can on the northeast corner.
492577019377352704,2014-07-25 07:48:07,You tell them that the drop point is Pershing Square.
492561920784732160,2014-07-25 06:48:07,Good.
492546822758350848,2014-07-25 05:48:08,Yeah.
492531721980497920,2014-07-25 04:48:07,Jack? Jack?
492516621659815936,2014-07-25 03:48:07,Jack are you listening to me?
492501522123460609,2014-07-25 02:48:07,Are you paying attention?
492486424348721154,2014-07-25 01:48:08,"Otherwise, you, the wildcat, and every innocent person on that bus are going to end up just like your friend."
492471321435979776,2014-07-25 00:48:07,You're going to pay me every dollar.
492456222088777729,2014-07-24 23:48:07,You can't beat me.
492441123626172416,2014-07-24 22:48:07,"Jack, we both know that he was the brains of your particular operation."
492426025158971392,2014-07-24 21:48:07,You're gonna do exactly as you're told.
492410928168570880,2014-07-24 20:48:08,"I'm going to rip your fucking spine out, I swear to God."

492199537360908288,2014-07-24 06:48:08,Gotcha.
492184436826320897,2014-07-24 05:48:08,I don't know. 10 minutes? It doesn't look good.
492169340343439360,2014-07-24 04:48:09,I'll see what I can find. How much time?
492154239628476417,2014-07-24 03:48:09,Can you get a fuel truck to pace us here? We're losing gas.

492078744362692608,2014-07-23 22:48:09,We're leaking gas?

492048545680076801,2014-07-23 20:48:09,What is that smell?
492033443530686465,2014-07-23 19:48:09,Ow! Other than that I'm fine.

491414379523751936,2014-07-22 02:48:12,We hit him!
491384181075607553,2014-07-22 00:48:12,Are you sure?
491369083745488896,2014-07-21 23:48:13,I can't see him.
491353980950171648,2014-07-21 22:48:12,You don't see him back back by the tire or something?

491308683649761280,2014-07-21 19:48:12,Oh my God. Oh my God. Go look! Lay down and look under the bus and see if you can see him.
491293588030898176,2014-07-21 18:48:13,He's not back here.
491278487316344832,2014-07-21 17:48:13,What?
491263389373435904,2014-07-21 16:48:13,He's not behind us.
491248289765806080,2014-07-21 15:48:13,Can you see him?
491233186630737920,2014-07-21 14:48:13,Somebody go to the back and check and see if he came out the back. Go!

491172792579022849,2014-07-21 10:48:13,Watch your back.
491157691201359872,2014-07-21 09:48:13,We're going to go after the source.
491142592243855361,2014-07-21 08:48:13,"Jack, I want you to get out of there and sit tight."
491127492845920256,2014-07-21 07:48:13,We can get to his place inside of 15 minutes.
491112391602470912,2014-07-21 06:48:13,"We got him. Jack, we found him."

490916106010234880,2014-07-20 17:48:15,"Yeah, I know. You're gonna have to cut off the sheath."
490901005022683136,2014-07-20 16:48:14,"Harry, it's covered."
490885902747447296,2014-07-20 15:48:14,"Jack, I'm gonna need you to look at the wire."
490870809645182977,2014-07-20 14:48:15,I'd use a fiber alloy.
490855704366813184,2014-07-20 13:48:14,That'd be too weak.

490765112773328896,2014-07-20 07:48:15,"Okay, we're gonna have to try to bypass the remote current with the battery."
490750012389740545,2014-07-20 06:48:15,This guy is nuts!
490734914052968449,2014-07-20 05:48:15,"Oh, thank you for the tip, Ortiz."
490719814952812545,2014-07-20 04:48:15,Just keep it steady.
490704714325954560,2014-07-20 03:48:15,"Oh, Christ."
490689612663119873,2014-07-20 02:48:14,"Have faith, sister."
490674513084813313,2014-07-20 01:48:14,This is not a very good plan.
490659418149625856,2014-07-20 00:48:15,Don't get dead.
490644321142448128,2014-07-19 23:48:16,"Okay, Jack. This is it."
490629218103877633,2014-07-19 22:48:15,Oh my God. He is insane.
490614121700675584,2014-07-19 21:48:16,What is he doing?
490599020503367680,2014-07-19 20:48:16,"Yeah. You be careful, Jack."
490583922879635456,2014-07-19 19:48:16,"Harry, you with me?"
490568823754354688,2014-07-19 18:48:16,"I just need a few minutes. If I can't do it by then, I can't do it at all."
490553719507795968,2014-07-19 17:48:15,We won't be able to hold this thing steady for very long.
490538626690723840,2014-07-19 16:48:17,I have no idea.
490523522922336257,2014-07-19 15:48:16,What is that?
490508421754404864,2014-07-19 14:48:15,"Hey, get your ass behind the yellow line."
490493325728702464,2014-07-19 13:48:16,"He didn't have to get on the bus in the first place, Ortiz."
490478227945582592,2014-07-19 12:48:16,"I'm telling you honey, he's somewhere jerking off."

490372529014333440,2014-07-19 05:48:16,"If we unload, he'll take them out, I guarantee."
490357434855067649,2014-07-19 04:48:17,He's been a step ahead every time.
490342333330628608,2014-07-19 03:48:17,"I don't know how, Mac. I just know he is."
490327234364706816,2014-07-19 02:48:17,How is that possible?
490312135382032385,2014-07-19 01:48:17,No way. He's ready for that.
490297035556270080,2014-07-19 00:48:17,"The choppers are gone, Jack. Let's dump the passengers now."
490281936691011585,2014-07-18 23:48:17,Don't forget about us.
490266836508741632,2014-07-18 22:48:17,Hey.
490251739090546688,2014-07-18 21:48:17,Don't worry. I won't go far.
490236638014865408,2014-07-18 20:48:17,I would.
490221538642124800,2014-07-18 19:48:17,"What, are you just gonna leave us here?"
490206438086557697,2014-07-18 18:48:17,It'll be okay.
490191339015782400,2014-07-18 17:48:17,Do you think that's a good idea?
490176244202209281,2014-07-18 16:48:18,Everybody sit tight. I'm getting off for a minute.
490161141746638848,2014-07-18 15:48:17,Just keep circling. You'll be fine.
490146047683854336,2014-07-18 14:48:18,What?
490130945714827264,2014-07-18 13:48:18,He's letting me off.
490115847533252608,2014-07-18 12:48:18,Yeah?
490100745128013825,2014-07-18 11:48:17,Could be.
490085648355713024,2014-07-18 10:48:18,"So, I guess there's a plan now?"
490070547590430720,2014-07-18 09:48:18,Do not attempt to grow a brain.
490055451187216384,2014-07-18 08:48:19,You know that I'm on top of you.

489934657379524608,2014-07-18 00:48:19,I need to talk to these people face to face. They think you're bullshit.
489919557935452161,2014-07-17 23:48:19,You want me to help you?
489904458659147776,2014-07-17 22:48:19,"Oh, no! That's not good."
489889354450341888,2014-07-17 21:48:18,You have to let me off.
489874259963957248,2014-07-17 20:48:19,"I got a medal, too, Jack. A medal and a pink slip and a ""sorry about your hand."""
489859160817676288,2014-07-17 19:48:19,I spent my life earning it.
489844056436903936,2014-07-17 18:48:18,"Oh, I earned it."
489828959811428353,2014-07-17 17:48:19,I know you want a shit load of money you didn't earn.
489813858651869184,2014-07-17 16:48:18,You don't even know me.
489798763360182272,2014-07-17 15:48:19,You don't know how I feel about this.
489783660149616640,2014-07-17 14:48:18,"Oh, that's unfair Jack."
489768567017967616,2014-07-17 13:48:20,Aren't you?
489753462821769216,2014-07-17 12:48:19,Do they think I'm doing this for fun?
489738364263075840,2014-07-17 11:48:19,Why are they messing with me?
489723263354818560,2014-07-17 10:48:19,"I hate negotiators, Jack. They talk to you like they're your best friend and they don't even know you."
489708167761125377,2014-07-17 09:48:20,Because I want you to help me to get it before it gets too late.
489693067721453568,2014-07-17 08:48:20,What are you telling me for?
489677970257108992,2014-07-17 07:48:20,Can you remember all that?
489662869298872320,2014-07-17 06:48:20,"I would like uh, large non-sequential bills in two clear plastic bags -- unmarked."
489647769112428547,2014-07-17 05:48:20,I wish that I had some loftier purpose but I'm afraid in the end it's just the money Jack.
489632670163296257,2014-07-17 04:48:20,I want money Jack.
489617575131623424,2014-07-17 03:48:21,What do you want?
489602470629228544,2014-07-17 02:48:20,But you've done alright for yourself.
489587369394176000,2014-07-17 01:48:19,"Some close calls, huh?"
489572273276198912,2014-07-17 00:48:20,"Very, very exciting Jack."
489557176449372160,2014-07-16 23:48:21,Yeah?
489542071292682240,2014-07-16 22:48:19,üì±‚òé
489526978836307969,2014-07-16 21:48:21,I already seen the airport.
489511876452048898,2014-07-16 20:48:20,Yeah? So?
489496781282361344,2014-07-16 19:48:21,We're at the airport.
489481676683509760,2014-07-16 18:48:20,"Yeah, let's hope it's built. Let's move!"
489466575368380416,2014-07-16 17:48:20,"That must be Bravo Tango, an emergency runway."
489451480282173440,2014-07-16 16:48:21,He's headed for the end of the field.
489436381291114496,2014-07-16 15:48:21,The choppers can't fly in there. It's restricted airspace.
489421283830943744,2014-07-16 14:48:21,He'll be able to circle the runways and buy us some time.
489406179454369794,2014-07-16 13:48:20,"That's my boy, Jack."
489391081520263169,2014-07-16 12:48:20,There's thousands of people there.
489375979630907392,2014-07-16 11:48:20,He's just entered the airport.
489360886692196352,2014-07-16 10:48:21,Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop!
489345792654598144,2014-07-16 09:48:23,Whoa!
489315586724216833,2014-07-16 07:48:21,Right here?
489300488362287104,2014-07-16 06:48:21,Yeah.
489285391908732929,2014-07-16 05:48:22,Where? Right here?
489270288077447169,2014-07-16 04:48:21,In there.
489255190676008960,2014-07-16 03:48:22,"Now, now. Get off this."
489240093119377408,2014-07-16 02:48:22,Get off this.
489224992085639169,2014-07-16 01:48:22,What?
489209895200124928,2014-07-16 00:48:22,Get off.
489194792757116931,2014-07-15 23:48:22,Ow.
489179694869123072,2014-07-15 22:48:22,Watch the road. You should have been a pilot.
489164594888200192,2014-07-15 21:48:22,Yeah? What was it?
489149497235095552,2014-07-15 20:48:22,I think you missed your calling.
489134396562108416,2014-07-15 19:48:22,Thank you. Thank you very much.
489119296958631937,2014-07-15 18:48:22,You are the man! You. Are. The. Man!
489104202090545152,2014-07-15 17:48:23,We made it.
489089099454640128,2014-07-15 16:48:22,We did it!
489043805320908800,2014-07-15 13:48:23,Is everybody okay?
489028703746146304,2014-07-15 12:48:23,Go on! Let's go!
489013603102519296,2014-07-15 11:48:23,Alright!
488998504937705472,2014-07-15 10:48:23,I'm okay.
488968306552889347,2014-07-15 08:48:23,Yeah.
488953205506584577,2014-07-15 07:48:23,You okay?
488938105747943424,2014-07-15 06:48:23,We are way out of control!
488923009306988545,2014-07-15 05:48:23,Yes!
488907909573509120,2014-07-15 04:48:23,________   üöå   ________
488892810272055297,2014-07-15 03:48:23,Shit!
488847512682246145,2014-07-15 00:48:24,"Oh, I want to see our baby."
488832411472379905,2014-07-14 23:48:23,Everybody hold on!
488817309562073089,2014-07-14 22:48:23,Oh shit.
488787110992703488,2014-07-14 20:48:23,Come on!
488772011607330816,2014-07-14 19:48:23,Oh God.
488756912930836480,2014-07-14 18:48:23,"Come on, come on."
488741814224973824,2014-07-14 17:48:23,Jack.
488741337835905024,2014-07-14 17:46:29,Yeah?
488740941927157760,2014-07-14 17:44:55,Jack!
488740879352360960,2014-07-14 17:44:40,Is this really going to work?
488740845655298048,2014-07-14 17:44:32,Hold on.
488740722925772800,2014-07-14 17:44:03,"Hey, I didn't mean to shoot the guy."
488726713652625408,2014-07-14 16:48:23,Put your bags underneath the seat.
488711617178136576,2014-07-14 15:48:24,"Let's put these underneath your seat, alright?"
488696517641781249,2014-07-14 14:48:24,That's all we can do.
488681418004783104,2014-07-14 13:48:23,That's it? That's it??
488666319374798850,2014-07-14 12:48:24,"When we hit the gap, heads down."
488651220236513281,2014-07-14 11:48:24,Everybody hold onto your seats or whatever you can.
488636121018945536,2014-07-14 10:48:24,Fine.
488621020123639808,2014-07-14 09:48:24,It's an interchange. There might be an incline. Floor it.
488605922852229121,2014-07-14 08:48:24,Floor it!
488590823408144384,2014-07-14 07:48:24,What?
488575724538703872,2014-07-14 06:48:24,Floor it.
488560623706324993,2014-07-14 05:48:24,What? Jack?
488545524555870211,2014-07-14 04:48:24,What then? What what?
488530425350860801,2014-07-14 03:48:24,"No, he'd have thought of that."
488515324296167424,2014-07-14 02:48:24,What if I shift into neutral and just keep the engine reving?
488500225749684224,2014-07-14 01:48:24,Jack.
488485127027052545,2014-07-14 00:48:24,Geez.
488470028572831744,2014-07-13 23:48:24,This is crazy.
488454929762107392,2014-07-13 22:48:24,50 feet a couple of miles ahead.
488439829944729602,2014-07-13 21:48:24,How big is a gap?
488424729481453568,2014-07-13 20:48:24,What do you mean?
488394533185404928,2014-07-13 18:48:25,There's a gap in the freeway.
488379432373989376,2014-07-13 17:48:24,What's the matter?
488364331923292161,2014-07-13 16:48:24,"Jack? Jack, what did he say?"
488349237332025344,2014-07-13 15:48:25,What did -- what did he say?
488334133517512705,2014-07-13 14:48:24,You know I can't.
488319036023787522,2014-07-13 13:48:25,"Jack, we got to get these people off the bus somehow."
488303939272445952,2014-07-13 12:48:26,What?
488288837202747394,2014-07-13 11:48:25,50 feet.
488273738161336321,2014-07-13 10:48:25,You're kidding. How big?
488258640881532929,2014-07-13 09:48:26,It's big.
488243538639872000,2014-07-13 08:48:25,There's a gap in the road up ahead.
488228441016111104,2014-07-13 07:48:25,50 feet. At least.
488213343732133888,2014-07-13 06:48:26,How big is the section?
488198243285614592,2014-07-13 05:48:26,Jack!
488183141270450177,2014-07-13 04:48:25,"Hey, get closer. Watch him in the mirror."
488168045253124099,2014-07-13 03:48:26,Get me closer!
488152943669940225,2014-07-13 02:48:25,You're fired. Everybody's fucking fired!
488137846943797248,2014-07-13 01:48:26,Fuck!
488122745704558592,2014-07-13 00:48:26,I guess they fell behind.
488107646054973441,2014-07-12 23:48:26,But it's on the map. It's finished on the goddamn map!
488092548204732416,2014-07-12 22:48:26,Section missing?
488077448328646656,2014-07-12 21:48:26,The aerial unit caught it. About 3 miles ahead. There's a section missing!
488062351363428352,2014-07-12 20:48:26,What are you talking about?
488047249662808065,2014-07-12 19:48:26,This freeway isn't finished!
488032151934230529,2014-07-12 18:48:26,What?
488017050875342848,2014-07-12 17:48:26,"Sir, we have a serious problem."
488001953264185345,2014-07-12 16:48:26,"Well, how far?!"
487986855254573057,2014-07-12 15:48:27,Are you sure?
487971754564780032,2014-07-12 14:48:27,üì±
487956656639062017,2014-07-12 13:48:27,Okay.
487941554502250496,2014-07-12 12:48:26,Big asshole.
487926454768766976,2014-07-12 11:48:26,"He's the asshole, Annie. The guy who put us here. Remember that."
487911359267348480,2014-07-12 10:48:27,"But, Annie, if she'd gotten off it would have killed us all."
487896259449995264,2014-07-12 09:48:27,She was scared. She was a nice lady who didn't deserve to get killed.
487881159758475265,2014-07-12 08:48:27,I know but she was so scared.
487866062017277952,2014-07-12 07:48:27,You should be glad. We all are. It doesn't mean you don't care.
487850959125508097,2014-07-12 06:48:27,Don't be.
487835859786285056,2014-07-12 05:48:27,I'm so sorry.
487820761957412864,2014-07-12 04:48:27,Mm-hmm.
487805664635269120,2014-07-12 03:48:28,You were glad you were still alive.
487790563429593088,2014-07-12 02:48:27,And when I saw her body fall under the bus it was like...
487775463096328194,2014-07-12 01:48:27,"I thought that was it. I thought that was the bomb. And I was dead."""
487760364822491139,2014-07-12 00:48:27,I know.
487745263935557632,2014-07-11 23:48:27,When that bomb went off...?
487730167171653632,2014-07-11 22:48:28,What can I do?
487715065575923712,2014-07-11 21:48:27,Mm-mm.
487699967901847552,2014-07-11 20:48:28,How are you doing? You alright?
487684867576967168,2014-07-11 19:48:27,Hey!
487669774474698753,2014-07-11 18:48:29,Why don't we just step outside!
487654669267644416,2014-07-11 17:48:27,"Oh, so you're a really tough guy huh? You're really tough, huh, Gigantor?"
487639569815203840,2014-07-11 16:48:28,Why don't you let everybody die in peace if that's what's gonna happen?
487624474456383488,2014-07-11 15:48:28,I think I have the right to be a little upset.
487609374945210368,2014-07-11 14:48:29,"Oh, yeah?"
487594273659817984,2014-07-11 13:48:28,He gets on everybody's nerves.
487579173846659072,2014-07-11 12:48:28,The guy's just talking crazy. He gets on my nerves.
487564073806995457,2014-07-11 11:48:28,"Hey, what are you talking about, man?"
487548974581039104,2014-07-11 10:48:28,"Hey! So, if you have a wife and I don't does that mean I'm expendable?"
487533877938778112,2014-07-11 09:48:29,"Oh, you do?"
487518778410803200,2014-07-11 08:48:29,"Hey, shut up man. I got a wife."
487503678392131584,2014-07-11 07:48:28,I mean for me to... I can't die here.
487488578025320448,2014-07-11 06:48:28,I can't be here. I can't -- you know. This is the wrong bus.

487458381372743680,2014-07-11 04:48:29,üì∫ She was pulled under the wheels. This is terrible.
487443282150965248,2014-07-11 03:48:29,üì∫ A woman caught in the blast fell.

487292288893075457,2014-07-10 17:48:29,"Come on, lady. Give me your hand."
487277188605947905,2014-07-10 16:48:29,He's going to be okay.
487262091632328704,2014-07-10 15:48:30,Yes!
487246993014546432,2014-07-10 14:48:30,Oh my God.
487231890101768193,2014-07-10 13:48:29,I'm alright. Thanks.

487201692509696000,2014-07-10 11:48:29,Stand clear!
487171495483809793,2014-07-10 09:48:30,I got him!
487156398795403264,2014-07-10 08:48:31,Hold it steady!
487141299196137473,2014-07-10 07:48:31,Okay Okay! Right there! Steady!
487126196782526464,2014-07-10 06:48:30,A little more!
487111102551973890,2014-07-10 05:48:31,Let's try it one more time.
487095998032777216,2014-07-10 04:48:30,"Okay, Annie. No problem."
487080899872161793,2014-07-10 03:48:30,Sorry! Sorry.
487065803141832707,2014-07-10 02:48:31,üööüí•üöå
487050700015153152,2014-07-10 01:48:30,"Okay, how's this?"
487035600894046208,2014-07-10 00:48:30,Okay.
487020503853305856,2014-07-09 23:48:31,"Annie, a little closer!"
487005401947205633,2014-07-09 22:48:30,"A little closer, Annie!"
486990304872898560,2014-07-09 21:48:31,Closer!
486975203692408833,2014-07-09 20:48:30,Alright.
486960105372397568,2014-07-09 19:48:31,Okay?
486945005634727936,2014-07-09 18:48:31,"Okay, Annie, get as close as you can."
486929908010991617,2014-07-09 17:48:31,Drive straight! Keep it straight!
486914806612377600,2014-07-09 16:48:30,"Okay, Annie."
486899710901223425,2014-07-09 15:48:31,Take care Sam.
486884610316333057,2014-07-09 14:48:31,Like I've been shot.
486869510306025472,2014-07-09 13:48:31,How are you feeling?
486854411507867648,2014-07-09 12:48:31,I can't stay! I can't stay.
486839314806890497,2014-07-09 11:48:32,"Hey, hey, hey, lady! I've got you."
486824215912275968,2014-07-09 10:48:32,What about the rest of us???
486809113087594496,2014-07-09 09:48:31,What about the rest of us?
486794016734711809,2014-07-09 08:48:32,Keep him straight or I think the wound will tear.
486778914853773312,2014-07-09 07:48:31,I need you to pass him to me.
486763817368440832,2014-07-09 06:48:32,"Ortiz, I'm gonna to need your help."
486748718666768384,2014-07-09 05:48:32,Ortiz.
486733620065755137,2014-07-09 04:48:32,Gigantor!
486718517622763521,2014-07-09 03:48:32,For now.
486703419432763392,2014-07-09 02:48:32,Just him?
486688320487817216,2014-07-09 01:48:32,We're going to get the bus driver off.
486673219110182912,2014-07-09 00:48:32,Get us closer!
486658121834565632,2014-07-08 23:48:32,Norwood!
486643021392269312,2014-07-08 22:48:32,He's letting us unload the driver.
486627923516870656,2014-07-08 21:48:32,And Jack -- don't slip.
486612823787581441,2014-07-08 20:48:32,You tell that wildcat behind the wheel not to slow down though or he won't even get a chance to bleed to death.
486597725132034048,2014-07-08 19:48:32,"Okay, son. You can try and unload the driver."
486582625792843776,2014-07-08 18:48:32,There's still gonna be plenty of us to kill.
486567527451877376,2014-07-08 17:48:33,It'll grease the wheels with the money men if you show a little charity.
486552425948381185,2014-07-08 16:48:32,No one gets off.
486537328760860672,2014-07-08 15:48:33,This man has no time.
486522230025646082,2014-07-08 14:48:33,I thought it was customary for a police officer to shoot the bad guys.
486507131399442432,2014-07-08 13:48:33,"Jack, tell me that you haven't been shooting the passengers."
486492029044543489,2014-07-08 12:48:32,As an act of faith. We have an injured man here. The driver's been shot.
486476930279956480,2014-07-08 11:48:33,We went over the rules.
486461831838302208,2014-07-08 10:48:33,"Look, you've got to let me have one."
486446733417648129,2014-07-08 09:48:33,I think we have trust but it looks on TV like you're trying to get those passengers off the bus.
486431635269615616,2014-07-08 08:48:33,Yeah?
486416535708119040,2014-07-08 07:48:33,"I mean, you know."
486401433315459072,2014-07-08 06:48:33,"Sure they are. They're the police. Hey, your taxes are paying their salary. If we die they got to take a pay cut."
486386336597684225,2014-07-08 05:48:33,Are they going to help us?
486371238382534658,2014-07-08 04:48:34,The bleeding is less but...
486356136421912578,2014-07-08 03:48:33,How's he doing?
486341039041417216,2014-07-08 02:48:34,Give him the number!
486325938867544064,2014-07-08 01:48:33,OK give him the number.
486310840262328322,2014-07-08 00:48:34,He's on the line for you.
486295741912985600,2014-07-07 23:48:34,Lieutenant? It's him! He wants to talk to Jack!
486280640887681026,2014-07-07 22:48:34,Harry's trying to find out who this guy is. We think maybe he's a cop.
486265544299917312,2014-07-07 21:48:34,Remember -- crazy not stupid!
486250441991127041,2014-07-07 20:48:34,I got orders! We move these people he'll see!
486235345868967937,2014-07-07 19:48:34,We got to get these people out of harm's way!
486220247331250176,2014-07-07 18:48:35,"There's no time for any stunts, Traven."
486205146817245186,2014-07-07 17:48:34,"We can't do it, sir!"
486190045867429889,2014-07-07 16:48:34,Let's get these passengers off the bus!
486174946263961600,2014-07-07 15:48:34,"Hey, Mac!"
486159850120806400,2014-07-07 14:48:35,Hey!
486144748738981890,2014-07-07 13:48:34,I've seen this asshole.
486129651756982272,2014-07-07 12:48:35,I want pictures!
486114550979129344,2014-07-07 11:48:35,He may not be LAPD but he's living here now.
486099451283398657,2014-07-07 10:48:35,This guy's drawing disability.
486084349956079616,2014-07-07 09:48:34,I want you to start going through the pension fund.
486069253758410752,2014-07-07 08:48:35,Forget the files.
486054153043451906,2014-07-07 07:48:35,I can't access all that.
486039055440703490,2014-07-07 06:48:35,He could be from anywhere.
486023953228390400,2014-07-07 05:48:35,No one's lost a thumb for at least the last 10 years.
486008854090489858,2014-07-07 04:48:35,We got no match for that description.
485993755200081921,2014-07-07 03:48:35,üòò
485978655395291136,2014-07-07 02:48:35,But I'm not available to drive tomorrow. Busy.
485963556727181313,2014-07-07 01:48:35,Then tomorrow we'll play another one.
485948457471848448,2014-07-07 00:48:35,What if you win?
485933360317886465,2014-07-06 23:48:35,"If he gets the money, he wins. If the bus blows up, he wins."
485918259103809537,2014-07-06 22:48:35,Nothing. It's a game.
485903161475862528,2014-07-06 21:48:36,What does that have to do with us?
485888061134237696,2014-07-06 20:48:35,A while back he held some people for ransom. It went sour and now he's a little pissed at me.
485872963367870464,2014-07-06 19:48:36,"So, um, what is this guy's deal?"
485857861142986754,2014-07-06 18:48:35,I don't buy that. It's not a very good way to make money.
485842767684194306,2014-07-06 17:48:37,"No, it's just a guy who wants money."
485827664687558656,2014-07-06 16:48:36,I mean what did we do? Bomb the guy's country or something?
485812564039700480,2014-07-06 15:48:35,"So, why is all this happening?"
485797467489718272,2014-07-06 14:48:36,Okay.
485782368288919553,2014-07-06 13:48:36,As opposed to ma'am?
485752170545836032,2014-07-06 11:48:36,It's my name. Annie.
485737068899741696,2014-07-06 10:48:36,What?
485721970953056257,2014-07-06 09:48:36,Annie.
485706871055990786,2014-07-06 08:48:36,"Ma'am, you did very well. Actually, you were incredible. I've never seen driving like that."
485691774178844672,2014-07-06 07:48:37,Hold the wheel? Thank you.
485676671995887616,2014-07-06 06:48:36,Could you do me a favor and hold the wheel for me for a second?
485661573675892738,2014-07-06 05:48:36,Shoot.
485646472981925888,2014-07-06 04:48:36,We have a window here. I want to make sure it stays open.
485631376855531521,2014-07-06 03:48:37,"Norwood, I want aerial units up ahead. No obstructions in the freeway."
485616277344354304,2014-07-06 02:48:37,Okay.
485601177220837376,2014-07-06 01:48:37,"Frank, get rid of that scaffolding and replace it with webbing."
485586078762401792,2014-07-06 00:48:37,Hurry up!
485570978093621249,2014-07-05 23:48:37,Hold it right there!
485555880666988546,2014-07-05 22:48:37,If you need to you go right ahead and vomit.
485540778748284929,2014-07-05 21:48:37,It's okay.
485525678708649984,2014-07-05 20:48:37,I can't think.
485510580468326400,2014-07-05 19:48:37,Oh my God. We might've died.
485495481221386240,2014-07-05 18:48:37,üöÅ Take me to that interchange at the 105.
485480385162125313,2014-07-05 17:48:38,Oh my God.

485450183900028928,2014-07-05 15:48:37,"Oh, God. Is everybody alright?"
485435086276665344,2014-07-05 14:48:38,"Whoo! Oh, my God!"

485238796783337472,2014-07-05 01:48:39,...you're right. We're going to tip over.
485223697133740034,2014-07-05 00:48:39,Oh God. We're going to tip over.
485208598721482752,2014-07-04 23:48:39,You can make it. Keep left. Keep left and you make it wide.
485193495926169600,2014-07-04 22:48:38,I can't make that turn.
485178400508628993,2014-07-04 21:48:39,There's a turn.
485163300133404674,2014-07-04 20:48:39,That's a dead end.
485148200517386240,2014-07-04 19:48:39,This should be it.
485133100687429633,2014-07-04 18:48:39,We got a hard right coming up at the construction site.
485118003621543936,2014-07-04 17:48:39,What's ugly?
485102902453604352,2014-07-04 16:48:39,How ugly?
485087803588358146,2014-07-04 15:48:39,"Alright, listen. You got an entrance coming up, Jack. It's gonna be a real ugly turn though."

484921712916459521,2014-07-04 04:48:40,There was no baby. It was full of cans.
484906611400396800,2014-07-04 03:48:39,Cans!!
484891512417710080,2014-07-04 02:48:40,I just hit the baby!

484755620172554240,2014-07-03 17:48:40,"Okay, wait a minute. Escort to where?"
484740521298907137,2014-07-03 16:48:40,"In a few blocks, we'll take a soft turn to the right."
484725421049913344,2014-07-03 15:48:40,Got it.
484710321735483392,2014-07-03 14:48:40,It's not in use. It'll be empty. You'll be totally clear.
484695225189691395,2014-07-03 13:48:41,They're gonna lead you to the 105 Freeway.
484680123803660288,2014-07-03 12:48:41,A few more blocks you'll come up to a soft turn ‚Äî right. Then hold straight. I've got some units waiting for you there.

484483834071621633,2014-07-02 23:48:41,I can see you. Just keep going straight.
484468737479700480,2014-07-02 22:48:42,I had to bail on the freeway. We're in the city.
484453636475322368,2014-07-02 21:48:42,Yeah. Mac where've you been?
484438538713194496,2014-07-02 20:48:42,Come on. Let's go.
484423437658509312,2014-07-02 19:48:42,No. I want to look at cops.
484408338545799168,2014-07-02 18:48:42,We did the mug shots already. It's not gonna help.
484393240229994496,2014-07-02 17:48:42,I want to look at the files for the last 10 years.
484378138109939712,2014-07-02 16:48:42,Wait a minute.
484363040305852416,2014-07-02 15:48:42,"Yeah, and everything we'd do to dismantle it."
484347941671280640,2014-07-02 14:48:42,He's an encyclopedia of bombs and knows every kind.
484332841715511296,2014-07-02 13:48:42,"This guy uses C4, dynamite, different trigger every time, and now he throws in this watch."
484317743542321152,2014-07-02 12:48:42,A bomber falls in love with one kind of bomb and they're very monogamous.
484302644094058497,2014-07-02 11:48:42,This guy has no M.O.
484287545589510146,2014-07-02 10:48:43,"Lots of people have watches, Harry."
484272452755664896,2014-07-02 09:48:44,The watch is a shitty timer. Why use it? What's he saying?
484257345245966336,2014-07-02 08:48:42,I don't get it.
484242246603005953,2014-07-02 07:48:43,üì∫We don't know what authorities are planning to do.

484166752876494848,2014-07-02 02:48:43,This is much better.
484151650559328256,2014-07-02 01:48:43,"Ow, my foot!"
484136551559860225,2014-07-02 00:48:43,Go! Go!
484121452656869376,2014-07-01 23:48:43,It's red!
484106352738848771,2014-07-01 22:48:43,Keep going.

484030857363980288,2014-07-01 17:48:43,Off! Off!
484015760088375296,2014-07-01 16:48:44,"Umm, stay on or get off? Stay on or get off?!"
484000658480037890,2014-07-01 15:48:43,Watch it! Watch it!
483985562219450369,2014-07-01 14:48:44,Okay.
483970460254609408,2014-07-01 13:48:44,Get on the shoulder.
483955361775251456,2014-07-01 12:48:44,Oh shit.
483940264969371649,2014-07-01 11:48:45,What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Which way? Which way???

483910064051216384,2014-07-01 09:48:44,Shit. What do I do?
483894963344646144,2014-07-01 08:48:44,"What's on your mind, Harry?"
483879864294862848,2014-07-01 07:48:44,Officer? Officer?!
483864765391831040,2014-07-01 06:48:44,Gold. Gold band. Fairly cheesy.
483849665847099392,2014-07-01 05:48:44,A watch? What kind of watch?
483834566273036289,2014-07-01 04:48:44,Three triggers. One on the axle I can't really see‚Ä¶ a cellular remote and a timer running off a wrist watch.
483804369834348544,2014-07-01 02:48:45,"Okay, alright. Just stay calm."
483789270537093120,2014-07-01 01:48:45,"Harry, there's enough C4 on this thing to put a hole in the world."
483774171147542528,2014-07-01 00:48:45,"O_______O oh, darn."
483759070071910400,2014-06-30 23:48:44,Fuck me!
483743972829839360,2014-06-30 22:48:45,Hold on..
483728872643362816,2014-06-30 21:48:45,Hold on.
483713772461121536,2014-06-30 20:48:44,What else??
483698673394536449,2014-06-30 19:48:45,What else?
483683577612083201,2014-06-30 18:48:45,That's your classic decoy.
483668474414133248,2014-06-30 17:48:45,"No! No, no! Don't do that. That's a decoy. Classic."
483653379134992384,2014-06-30 16:48:46,He can reach the circuit wire.
483638278793351168,2014-06-30 15:48:45,I think I can reach the circuit wire.
483623177201807360,2014-06-30 14:48:45,Brass fittings.
483608081499045889,2014-06-30 13:48:46,Brass fittings!
483592981975281665,2014-06-30 12:48:46,There's a pretty big wad.
483577879544868864,2014-06-30 11:48:45,Okay! We got a wad! Pretty big!
483562782953340928,2014-06-30 10:48:46,"Sir, take this. I want you to tell him what I see."
483547685043965952,2014-06-30 09:48:46,"Alright, Harry. We're in. Passenger relay."
483532583532101632,2014-06-30 08:48:46,"Access panel... in the floor... underneath you, man."
483517486315216896,2014-06-30 07:48:46,Hold on. Yes?
483502385751289856,2014-06-30 06:48:46,Excuse me! Excuse me!
483487287469043712,2014-06-30 05:48:46,"I can't get under the bus right now, Harry. It's kind of in motion."
483472187613904896,2014-06-30 04:48:46,Probably was rigged to one of the axles.
483457087444639746,2014-06-30 03:48:46,Then it's gonna be under the bus.
483441988146970624,2014-06-30 02:48:46,"No, it's clean."
483426887788531713,2014-06-30 01:48:46,"Excuse me, ma'am."
483411790466789376,2014-06-30 00:48:46,See any wires or anything?
483396691786084352,2014-06-29 23:48:47,Has it been fucked with? Or loosened? Or wires?
483381593143144448,2014-06-29 22:48:47,Check the speedometer.
483366493397069825,2014-06-29 21:48:47,Where do we start?

483336291795210240,2014-06-29 19:48:46,"Ah, would that be you, Jack?"
483321196495110144,2014-06-29 18:48:47,üì∫Minutes ago a Los Angeles police officer boarded the bus by jumping onto it from a moving car.
483306095918608384,2014-06-29 17:48:47,üì∫...at the Lincoln on-ramp. It began picking up speed swerving and hasn't slowed down since.
483290997388873729,2014-06-29 16:48:47,üì∫...has been driven off the road by the speeding bus. The bus apparently came onto the freeway...

483215501145829376,2014-06-29 11:48:47,Speeding?
483200402175713280,2014-06-29 10:48:47,What for?
483185300231815169,2014-06-29 09:48:47,"Well, I should probably tell you that I'm taking the bus because I had my driver's license revoked."
483170204738809856,2014-06-29 08:48:48,That's right.
483155102664900608,2014-06-29 07:48:47,"So you're a cop, right?"
483140006333018114,2014-06-29 06:48:48,Good plan.
483124905450287105,2014-06-29 05:48:48,Just for you to drive. We're okay for now. Just keep us above 50.
483109806048149504,2014-06-29 04:48:48,I'm fine. I'm fine. Just tell me what the plan is. Is there a plan???
483094707484884993,2014-06-29 03:48:48,I need to know! Can you handle this bus?
483079605834633216,2014-06-29 02:48:47,"Oh, sure. It's just like driving a really big Pinto."
483064507837583362,2014-06-29 01:48:48,"Miss, can you handle this bus?"
483049407189762049,2014-06-29 00:48:47,"Sam, lift your head."

483019209685733376,2014-06-28 22:48:48,"Put pressure front and back, and keep his legs up, and put this under his head."
483004110975692800,2014-06-28 21:48:48,He's bleeding so much. I don't know what to do. There's so much blood!

480663731223814145,2014-06-22 10:48:58,You ruined a man's life's work and you think you can walk away?
480648631578398721,2014-06-22 09:48:58,You couldn't understand the kind of commitment that I have.
480633534701268992,2014-06-22 08:48:59,Two years I spent setting up that elevator job. Two years I invested myself in it.
480618436494516224,2014-06-22 07:48:59,You think I wouldn't have been prepared?
480603334076665856,2014-06-22 06:48:58,Jesus!

480316450389757952,2014-06-21 11:49:00,I'm alright.
480301353315487744,2014-06-21 10:49:00,Ho!
480286249488363521,2014-06-21 09:48:59,That's right.
480271155572387840,2014-06-21 08:49:01,Right Chief?
480256054379294720,2014-06-21 07:49:00,Luck runs out sooner or later.
480240953777586176,2014-06-21 06:49:00,Guts'll get you so far and then they'll get you killed.
480225854283206656,2014-06-21 05:49:00,Do you listen? Do you ever -- because I am not going to be around to back you up so you better start thinking.
480210756206481411,2014-06-21 04:49:00,"Harry, come on man. I mean we won. We got him."
480195654564585473,2014-06-21 03:49:00,6 inches off the mark and they're giving the medal to my wife.
480180559004459008,2014-06-21 02:49:01,Phew! And I got a bullet in me.
480165457857499136,2014-06-21 01:49:00,This guy could've blown us up at any time.
480150357868158976,2014-06-21 00:49:00,You better understand it. We were dealing with a total psycho.
480135260470910978,2014-06-20 23:49:01,"No, we were lucky."
480120160154435584,2014-06-20 22:49:01,No -- You were lucky.
480105060165099520,2014-06-20 21:49:00,"Yeah, we're good."
480089962658795520,2014-06-20 20:49:01,We got the bad guy and we didn't lose any civilians.
480074862212292608,2014-06-20 19:49:01,"We're the two luckiest guys in the world, you know that?"

479591687753179136,2014-06-19 11:49:03,You shot me. I can't believe it.
479576589227679745,2014-06-19 10:49:03,"And thanks to them, the only life taken by the terrorist's bomb was his own."

479380297025212416,2014-06-18 21:49:03,"Shut up, Harry."
479365198340296704,2014-06-18 20:49:04,Go ahead. Drop the stick. Do it.
479350100066852864,2014-06-18 19:49:04,"Oh! In 200 years, we've gone from ""I regret but I have one life to give for my country"" to ""fuck you""???"
479335000878223360,2014-06-18 18:49:04,Fuck you.

479244405199482880,2014-06-18 12:49:04,Why? Because you didn't get to kill everyone?!
479229305080127489,2014-06-18 11:49:04,"This day has been real disappointing, I don't mind saying."
479214208068763648,2014-06-18 10:49:05,End of the line.
479199105437024257,2014-06-18 09:49:04,It's on three. Let's move!
479184009621016576,2014-06-18 08:49:05,Lieutenant? We've got movement on the freight elevator.
479168911074537473,2014-06-18 07:49:05,Briggs! Where's Jack and Harry?
479153808518295553,2014-06-18 06:49:04,I want a location on those goddamn shots!
479138708860317698,2014-06-18 05:49:04,At least that's what they'll think!
479123610569682945,2014-06-18 04:49:05,Standard flanking deployment right? Maybe we'll get off on the third floor huh?
479108510840418305,2014-06-18 03:49:05,There's gonna be 50 cops waiting for you in the basement.
479093412172296192,2014-06-18 02:49:05,Got enough dynamite strapped to his chest to blow a building in half. Now what do you do?
479078315773284352,2014-06-18 01:49:05,Terrorist holding a police hostage.
479063215058325504,2014-06-18 00:49:05,"Pop quiz, hotshot."

479033014932893696,2014-06-17 22:49:05,I don't suppose anybody will give me 3 million just for you.

478942421183516672,2014-06-17 16:49:06,What?
478927320787349505,2014-06-17 15:49:05,Will the mystery guest please sign in?
478912222203088897,2014-06-17 14:49:06,What about the freight elevators?
478897124315103233,2014-06-17 13:49:06,Passenger cars were stopped. They checked them out.
478882023474352129,2014-06-17 12:49:06,The elevators.
478866925053698048,2014-06-17 11:49:06,He'd want to be here but he'd want to stay mobile. Right?
478851824699445249,2014-06-17 10:49:06,He's not going to corner himself in a building. We evacuated anyway. Come on.
478836727566438400,2014-06-17 09:49:06,No. He knew we were up to something. He's close by.
478821627656818689,2014-06-17 08:49:06,He could've blown that thing from Pacoima.
478806527029952513,2014-06-17 07:49:06,He's here.
478791435580211200,2014-06-17 06:49:08,I don't know. Maybe he couldn't hold his wad long enough. It's a common problem among middle-aged men -- so I'm told.
478776327873363968,2014-06-17 05:49:06,Why does he do that? He's losing his $3 million.
478761229695975424,2014-06-17 04:49:06,"Ah, no no. He jumped the gun. We had three minutes left."
478746130847522816,2014-06-17 03:49:06,Is your watch slow?
478731032229736448,2014-06-17 02:49:07,"Oh, good. That's good to know."
478715931359576064,2014-06-17 01:49:06,Elevator dropped.
478700833140244481,2014-06-17 00:49:07,"It was great for me. How was it for you, honey?"
478685733801033728,2014-06-16 23:49:07,Was it good for you?

478353550687236096,2014-06-16 01:49:08,Step back.
478338451226370048,2014-06-16 00:49:08,We've got you ma'am.

477945870613106688,2014-06-14 22:49:10,Ho.
477930774507696128,2014-06-14 21:49:10,Cool.
477915673302036480,2014-06-14 20:49:10,"Aw, come on. 30 more years of this you get a tiny pension and a cheap gold watch."
477900574713999361,2014-06-14 19:49:10,"Tell me again, Harry. Why did I take this job?"
477885476037091329,2014-06-14 18:49:10,I need the goddamn money now.
477870376555257856,2014-06-14 17:49:10,I can't get any more time. He's not talking!
477855274372325376,2014-06-14 16:49:10,Six minutes.
477840182045995008,2014-06-14 15:49:11,It'll hold.
477825079502307328,2014-06-14 14:49:11,You sure it'll hold?
477809979160686592,2014-06-14 13:49:10,üöß
477794878143729666,2014-06-14 12:49:10,"No, we just take them out of the equation."
477779778812903424,2014-06-14 11:49:10,"Wait, where you going?
What's going on?
Don't go!
Don't leave us here!"
477764681054953472,2014-06-14 10:49:11,We're not going to shoot them right?
477749584437841920,2014-06-14 09:49:11,Maybe we can do something about those hostages.
477734483135709184,2014-06-14 08:49:11,"Jack, come on."
477719382391390208,2014-06-14 07:49:11,How much you think that elevator weights?
477704283937185792,2014-06-14 06:49:11,This is taking way too long.
477689184472137728,2014-06-14 05:49:11,"Well, right now Mac outranks your gut so we sit."
477674086038908929,2014-06-14 04:49:11,I don't know. Gut feeling.
477658988771700736,2014-06-14 03:49:12,Why?
477643887754756096,2014-06-14 02:49:11,"Harry, this is wrong. He's going to blow it anyway."
477628787438280704,2014-06-14 01:49:11,"You're deeply nuts. You know that? ""Shoot the hostage..."""
477613691718729728,2014-06-14 00:49:12,Take her out of the equation. Go for the good wound. He can't get to the plane with her. Clear shot.
477598589481283585,2014-06-13 23:49:11,What?
477583492767686657,2014-06-13 22:49:12,Shoot the hostage.
477568390731542529,2014-06-13 21:49:11,Jack.
477553294802292736,2014-06-13 20:49:12,Alright. Pop quiz. Airport. Gunman with one hostage. He's using her for cover. He's almost to a plane. You're 100 feet away.
477538190572531713,2014-06-13 19:49:11,"Mac said we hold, so we hold."
477523093389185024,2014-06-13 18:49:12,"Well, what's to like?"
477507993596997632,2014-06-13 17:49:12,I don't like it.
477492893855150080,2014-06-13 16:49:11,I don't recognize the work but he's a pro. He's cutting it close.
477477794952146944,2014-06-13 15:49:12,Anyone we know?
477462696887988224,2014-06-13 14:49:12,Looks pretty solid.
477447598450540546,2014-06-13 13:49:12,You're the expert. I just work here.
477432501099446272,2014-06-13 12:49:13,What do you think?
477417400459997185,2014-06-13 11:49:12,Makes no sense.
477402300835590144,2014-06-13 10:49:12,How come they sent cops here? Shouldn't they send repair guys?
477387200481329152,2014-06-13 09:49:12,We'll have you out of there as soon as possible. (Am I lying?)
477372102035525632,2014-06-13 08:49:12,"Hey, come on! What are you guys waiting for?"
477357003174473728,2014-06-13 07:49:13,There's been an elevator malfunction so just relax.
477341902442733568,2014-06-13 06:49:12,What are you doing up there?
477326802797330433,2014-06-13 05:49:12,Thank God.
477311703189712900,2014-06-13 04:49:12,Ladies and gentlemen this is the LAPD.
477296604236369921,2014-06-13 03:49:12,Who's up there? Who's up there? What's going on?
477281505463369728,2014-06-13 02:49:13,"Come on man. Get us out of here!
Hello!
Please help us!
Come on man!
Help!
Please, get us out of here! Please!"
477266408498143232,2014-06-13 01:49:13,Hello?!
477251309616111616,2014-06-13 00:49:13,32.
477236210503389184,2014-06-12 23:49:13,31...
477221107137667072,2014-06-12 22:49:12,30!!!!
477206009610776576,2014-06-12 21:49:13,All the way down to the lobby! Let's go folks!
477190911172947968,2014-06-12 20:49:13,29.
477175812899098624,2014-06-12 19:49:13,"Hurry, folks, but watch your step!"
477160712792330240,2014-06-12 18:49:13,Looks like we're walking.
477145612584902656,2014-06-12 17:49:13,"Worthy, Briggs, I want you to secure the base area -- no one in or out. Everyone else I want you to affirm building evac. Move!"
477130514055192576,2014-06-12 16:49:13,I want reports only. We're in a holding pattern.
477115415894560769,2014-06-12 15:49:14,The nearest access panel's on the 2nd floor in the lobby.
477100314982502400,2014-06-12 14:49:13,Fine. The two of you check it out.
477085216968679425,2014-06-12 13:49:14,"Yeah, right."
477070117881147392,2014-06-12 12:49:14,"Sir, Harry volunteers to examine the device."
477055016612532225,2014-06-12 11:49:13,"The bomber's also wired the hatch to trigger the bomb which seats him in the ""crazy but not stupid"" section."
477039918011543553,2014-06-12 10:49:14,This is an express elevator. The only way in or out is through access panels.
477024821046300672,2014-06-12 09:49:14,We can't just unload the passengers?
477009719651876866,2014-06-12 08:49:14,"The city would like to avoid that event, Officer Traven."
476994618848862208,2014-06-12 07:49:13,"Yeah, the basement."
476979520377847809,2014-06-12 06:49:14,Anything else that'll keep this elevator from falling?
476964421177057280,2014-06-12 05:49:14,That leaves us 23 minutes exactly.
476949322257272832,2014-06-12 04:49:14,He gave one hour.
476934224222486529,2014-06-12 03:49:14,What's our clock?
476919127064326144,2014-06-12 02:49:15,The bomber wants $3 million or he blows the emergency brakes.
476904025476960256,2014-06-12 01:49:14,"Alright gentlemen, what we have here are 13 passengers in an express elevator... below floor 30. Bomb's already taken out cables."
476873825368293376,2014-06-11 23:49:14,"Now, there's no other way -- no doors-- no other way in or out except through access panels is that correct?"
476858730286297089,2014-06-11 22:49:15,"Yes, sir."
476843629059641344,2014-06-11 21:49:15,"Mr. Bagwell, make sure these other elevators remain locked down and empty."

476662440831102976,2014-06-11 09:49:16,"Marty, I couldn't be happier with the way this worked out."
