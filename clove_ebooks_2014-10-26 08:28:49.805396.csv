471828872074653696,2014-05-29 01:42:23,@Muffadins Strafing is totally a thing.
471828852386590720,2014-05-29 01:42:19,@Muffadins You're either grossly tired because it's 7AM and you have the least contact with real women; clothes are just part of that list
471828838079823873,2014-05-29 01:42:15,"@Muffadins ...wait, are you flying Air Canada DOESN'T, and it's fucking heartbreaking"
471828833264734208,2014-05-29 01:42:14,@Muffadins Kim I once made a Street Fighter: The Movie joke in bed so I DID get to take a break for an hour to see the floor.
471828823177457664,2014-05-29 01:42:12,@Muffadins I don't know what it says about me that he was sober enough to have the coordination to do it
471828821554249728,2014-05-29 01:42:11,@Muffadins I think I know about this because it's a great piece of serialized fiction but also a REALLY CLEARLY BROKEN ONE.
471828817456418816,2014-05-29 01:42:10,@Muffadins omg it really is that even possible
471828805024514048,2014-05-29 01:42:07,@Muffadins Every time I see my name rendered as skinny and it made me cry so i had to draw this robot Frog Fractions 2 all along...
471828803426476032,2014-05-29 01:42:07,@Muffadins This is a title that sounds dramatic until you realize it's a Batman ref AND most people on DS9 haven't seen moonlight
471828796065452032,2014-05-29 01:42:05,"@Muffadins They're just models, because it does a LOT of super interesting things."

471828776968814592,2014-05-29 01:42:01,@Muffadins Well this is probably going to be able to make LESS money?
471828776327077888,2014-05-29 01:42:01,"@Muffadins let's make out with you in Japan just not at that particular show, it's such an awful, corporate mess"

471828769364537344,2014-05-29 01:41:59,"@Muffadins On the one hand, it would be ADORABLE, so,"
471828768714424320,2014-05-29 01:41:59,@Muffadins I've heard of people in my mentions telling me that it's not about a videogame

471828737861095424,2014-05-29 01:41:51,@Muffadins omg I got to meet him and they are allowed to do
471828737106116608,2014-05-29 01:41:51,"@Muffadins I wasn't complaining, my day-to-day sales come when you're on the front page"

471828729711575040,2014-05-29 01:41:49,@Muffadins It's so she will not see this
471828728725921792,2014-05-29 01:41:49,@Muffadins I can see why I just inexplicably pulled my wallet out
471828726817492992,2014-05-29 01:41:49,@Muffadins After having worked with animated GIFs on the software side I would be happy to see it up!
471828719645257728,2014-05-29 01:41:47,@Muffadins So it's actually pretty much impossible to mentally map that way.
471828719079022592,2014-05-29 01:41:47,@Muffadins Patrick I think I've figured out a way to do an entire interview filtered through the ISS?
471828711776731136,2014-05-29 01:41:45,"@Muffadins sexy is good, but I have NO CLUE as to the context"
471828709931229185,2014-05-29 01:41:45,@Muffadins currently brainstorming ways to make you blush like that again but in a photobooth
471828709327257600,2014-05-29 01:41:45,@Muffadins It's a very confused impression of how espionage really works
471828704952602625,2014-05-29 01:41:44,@Muffadins The dub is kinda in a dry spell in the point I'm at.
471828704252162048,2014-05-29 01:41:43,"@Muffadins I'm pretty sure this is probably going to make me feel great about how much worse it COULD be, on reflection"
471828692914933760,2014-05-29 01:41:41,@Muffadins oh my god no I DON'T SEE HOW YOU MIGHT ASSUME THAT BUT I PROMISE IT'S NOT TOO LATE
471828689823752192,2014-05-29 01:41:40,"@Muffadins Well, I think it's to pay more in taxes than you make in a year."
471828682802487296,2014-05-29 01:41:38,@Muffadins Mattie your roommate drama sounds amazing how is this a thing?
471828405688999936,2014-05-29 01:40:32,"@Muffadins Hey, what's most important is to figure out how to best make him lovable"
471828395379404800,2014-05-29 01:40:30,@Muffadins Just gonna let my shirt do all the Maquis in the DMZ.
471828392653094913,2014-05-29 01:40:29,"@Muffadins Here is the thing I didn't realize: in this universe, it was a show about General Shran instead."
471828370301267970,2014-05-29 01:40:24,@Muffadins oh god I am going to insist on this being a matter of continuity: aren't kids SUPPOSED to hate their parents?
471828365092335617,2014-05-29 01:40:23,@Muffadins imo a great way to tell the artist on your keyboard to prevent you from working (giving)

471828355277672448,2014-05-29 01:40:20,@Muffadins Leigh if I see the relevance?
471828349023973377,2014-05-29 01:40:19,@Muffadins I do not think it would be more novel to write spy fiction that DIDN'T feature a shred of fantasy/science-fiction.
471828344921919488,2014-05-29 01:40:18,"@Muffadins jesus, he was following me, jesus, Jesus, it just gets worse and worse"

471828330615144450,2014-05-29 01:40:14,@Muffadins Apparently there are zero ulterior motives to this agenda

471828318778826752,2014-05-29 01:40:12,@Muffadins I can confirm this
471828317033988096,2014-05-29 01:40:11,"@Muffadins This is that they're so alien compared to all other known weapons, sure, that works."

471828313196204032,2014-05-29 01:40:10,@Muffadins Here is an extremely reasonable question.
