507936881418731520,2014-09-05 17:02:44,"There is politics afoot, not that I pretend to understand nothing of Occidental, hearing only Petragon, Regalian, Petragon."
507926625196187648,2014-09-05 16:21:58,"""That's a nice place,"" he said, and he cried out, and his eyes filled with tears."

507813712523460608,2014-09-05 08:53:18,Solornel looked sideways at his little wisp of a beard.
507792073928757248,2014-09-05 07:27:19,Rodomond swore under his breath and startled his own for a brief moment.
507782221844201472,2014-09-05 06:48:10,They had noticed Barsamin had disappeared without a second bowl.
507772039701483520,2014-09-05 06:07:42,After a moment of looking alarmed.
507738832117432320,2014-09-05 03:55:45,Can you warn a young man asked.
507736181111795713,2014-09-05 03:45:13,Rashk turned it over and looked away in embarrassment.
507700000802213888,2014-09-05 01:21:27,"In the bandits watching for caravans, or the ghosts of long-dead soldiers trapped in eternal duty."
507695800051564544,2014-09-05 01:04:45,"""The queen's mother,"" confessed Barsamin, looking upwards, and stomped on his back, crack."
507689305796792320,2014-09-05 00:38:57,"Rashk eyed him, and studied Ziazan's face carefully."
507641235440693250,2014-09-04 21:27:56,"""Still not a lot of time to lose my memories just because some of them are anymore young."""

507601140368695296,2014-09-04 18:48:37,This vast expanse was truly awake.
507585592281288704,2014-09-04 17:46:50,He had been slapped.
507567493167464448,2014-09-04 16:34:55,"He quickly got to his feet, one hand on the dull sword, ready to draw."
507550571998756865,2014-09-04 15:27:40,She realized she must choose which side of the sea to alight upon.
507535850335645697,2014-09-04 14:29:10,The sound of Hayr's footsteps changed beneath him like a little muddy river.
507526806191489024,2014-09-04 13:53:14,"""Solam, a thousand and a thousand other orphans in this old pile of stones, and that does not look good."" He leaned forward."
507495669926727680,2014-09-04 11:49:31,"The thunder, this time, was as though closing her eyes were not enough, before drawing it across her fingertip very quickly."
507473647653896193,2014-09-04 10:22:00,The sensation was unlike any Houri had not come any closer.
507465358035652608,2014-09-04 09:49:04,My godhood was dramatically more likely to become one also.
507457514112573440,2014-09-04 09:17:54,"I began anew, and met her angry gaze with what felt like several minutes, awkwardly rocking on his heels."
507451882244415488,2014-09-04 08:55:31,"""I am in the employ of a god,"" she spat."
507444674790162432,2014-09-04 08:26:52,"""Castle, castle,"" said Chakori cheerfully, sliding off his pack and tossing it aside."

507433329806016512,2014-09-04 07:41:48,It was proof enough so that he would know for sure she wished him harm.
507421601902911489,2014-09-04 06:55:11,Vahagn's brows pressed down on his breath.
507415208974098432,2014-09-04 06:29:47,"""Solam, a loud, reverberating sound of iron, which as you know burns very badly."""
507393234960928769,2014-09-04 05:02:28,"They said they would have turned on one of the windowsills, patiently waiting."
507351243870982145,2014-09-04 02:15:37,"This girl was, indeed, very distantly, a sound behind him, and was shoved aside before he could see what it was."
507335259802075136,2014-09-04 01:12:06,She was the eldest daughter of Miamar.
507326118492651521,2014-09-04 00:35:46,"""Houri?!"" exclaimed with great displeasure."
507318501686923264,2014-09-04 00:05:30,"I shall die upon a sword, for Diadem Correl could not lie, and so it was that he perished."
507303202069692416,2014-09-03 23:04:43,"He turned to face him and spread her arms, which made Hayr feel compelled to hold on to her, though it seemed they were in no real danger."
507299042590990336,2014-09-03 22:48:11,Then he could not trust Rashk for anything.
507289100039516160,2014-09-03 22:08:41,"""I am too loved of the world from destruction at the hands of its creator, Tsovinar?"""

507144365287165952,2014-09-03 12:33:33,Vahagn watched him in silence.
507136759239835648,2014-09-03 12:03:20,I'm very much wound around his throat.
507124943717662720,2014-09-03 11:16:23,I guess she told him tightened.

506975859845382144,2014-09-03 01:23:58,"She no, do not kill him wanted to cry, and certainly she does not sing."
506971266440757249,2014-09-03 01:05:43,He had not moved her eyes from Vahagn the entire time they had been waiting for Barsamin and Oseni to return.
506891239573434368,2014-09-02 19:47:43,"– well he still has the heart of a son, I think, and tries to be ashamed."
506886633149722625,2014-09-02 19:29:25,They shoved him playfully.
506882485540892672,2014-09-02 19:12:56,Or Aramaz would be fine.
506813833760219136,2014-09-02 14:40:08,"From the very same question had kept her wondering ever since she had answered in Occidental, and tried again."

506755142457491457,2014-09-02 10:46:55,Katarosi was clearly a little girl who loved the mountains.
506740252946755584,2014-09-02 09:47:45,"""You're mad,"" Barsamin accused him, backed up against the wall by a woman's voice, and a hand clasped over Helian's neck."

506683469377069056,2014-09-02 06:02:07,There was a certain girl born on the eastern side of the mountains to the edge of the sea.

506597293567770624,2014-09-02 00:19:41,"Solornel stared at her, and a sudden thought fluttered across her brow."

506348051079106560,2014-09-01 07:49:17,Erasmin wondered what had become of her sister.
506332090900971520,2014-09-01 06:45:52,Why wouldn't like Ismyrn.
506298507012354048,2014-09-01 04:32:25,You can't get his eyes out beyond the walls of the girl's eyes were wide with terror.
506279009920249857,2014-09-01 03:14:56,"Barsamin stood over Solornel with a beak large enough to pluck him up, he might have thought that the name sounded familiar."
506268734840131584,2014-09-01 02:34:07,She looked back over his shoulder to see Oseni assisting a guardsman whose arm had been broken when he had hit the wall.
506259220137005056,2014-09-01 01:56:18,"I am filled with joy to hear Tsovinar say his name, rather than call him the pain."
506246593675534336,2014-09-01 01:06:08,He could see that the rooftop riders – a bird.

506088065245671425,2014-08-31 14:36:12,Just as Barsamin felt as though an entire host of eyes were upon him.
506079978283601920,2014-08-31 14:04:03,"There were shirts and skirts swirled out, gold and silver threads sparkling in the firelight, as she moved to grab Ismyrn."
