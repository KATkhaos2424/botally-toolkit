444719573678309376,2014-03-15 06:19:43,@Kitty_Hawk343 Thank you! &lt;3
444699565342470144,2014-03-15 05:00:13,And I get to do my favorite thing which is helping so many dogs by educating people. #Cesar911
444699489429757952,2014-03-15 04:59:55,"I just want to say that I'm truly having a great time with this new show #Cesar911, I get to be me in so many ways."
444699327521239040,2014-03-15 04:59:16,I was so impressed by Ms. G's progress with Beau! #Cesar911
444698884934098945,2014-03-15 04:57:30,Hahah. Takis I hope you get ALL the spoons! #Cesar911
444698505936793600,2014-03-15 04:56:00,"Hilarious. I love that. ""You knowww what!"" #Cesar911"
444698406934425600,2014-03-15 04:55:36,"I love this part where Takis ""unveils"" his t-shirt! LOL! #Cesar911"
444697827306770432,2014-03-15 04:53:18,Especially because the last thing I want is for a misunderstood Pit Bull to be falsely labeled aggressive due to poor leadership. #Cesar911
444697759510065152,2014-03-15 04:53:02,I was so happy that the Pit Bull's owner let me help. It was a great feeling to be able to jump in and help. #Cesar911
444697674957078528,2014-03-15 04:52:42,The dog's owner wasn't completely in control and the dog's harness was way to loose. #Cesar911
444697603150598144,2014-03-15 04:52:25,"If you noticed me looking at the camera just now, I don't usually do that. But I was really concerned. #Cesar911"
444697516873764864,2014-03-15 04:52:04,I was genuinely concerned that the Pit Bull would get loose because the harness it was wearing was too loose. #Cesar911
444697419192623104,2014-03-15 04:51:41,I was really nervous. #Cesar911
444696322122067968,2014-03-15 04:47:19,I was truly freaked out by that. See what happens after the break.. #Cesar911
444696143977406464,2014-03-15 04:46:37,This scene was completely spontaneous and really caught me off guard. #Cesar911
444696111056310272,2014-03-15 04:46:29,"It's just with Beau, she never delivered rule, boundaries and limitations. #Cesar911"
444695997671698433,2014-03-15 04:46:02,What Ms. G does reminds me of Mutt-i-grees. Ms. G is a really loving Pack Leader. #Cesar911
444695964784144384,2014-03-15 04:45:54,Freedom writers allows kids to focus their energy on something positive that stimulates the mind &amp; allows them to be a part of the Pack.
444695901328519168,2014-03-15 04:45:39,It was so awesome seeing Ms. G realize all the lessons she already knew! #Cesar911
444695592883601409,2014-03-15 04:44:26,TSCH! Works every time. :D #Cesar911
444695406371274752,2014-03-15 04:43:41,Does your dog bark if you leave him/her out of the room you're in? #Cesar911
444695150803943424,2014-03-15 04:42:40,"I love when she said ""I teach to them I dont teach at them""  I will steal that BTW! #Cesar911"
444695119267000320,2014-03-15 04:42:33,To a lot of people it wouldn't be a big deal but to her it was the beginning of being able to take Beau everywhere. #Cesar911
444694967869386753,2014-03-15 04:41:57,"When she did it, she truly felt like she'd achieved a lot, she conquered a mountain. #Cesar911"
444694808918233089,2014-03-15 04:41:19,And we're back! Do you think Ms. G will be able to get Beau into the car on her own? #Cesar911
444693780344496128,2014-03-15 04:37:13,That was a really honest celebration from Ms. G. It was beautiful to be present at that moment when Beau went in to the car. #Cesar911
444693702284296192,2014-03-15 04:36:55,Does anyone else have trouble getting your dog(s) into the car? #Cesar911
444693383080972290,2014-03-15 04:35:39,"She got trapped in what I call affection, affection, affection way of being. #Cesar911"
444693338726203392,2014-03-15 04:35:28,But even somebody like Ms. G. w/ all the formulas to work w/ troubled kids couldn't apply her philosophy she on her dog.
444693193464877056,2014-03-15 04:34:53,"In a way we're very similar because I work with dogs that people call ""troubled"" or a ""lost cause"". #Cesar911"
444693135826771968,2014-03-15 04:34:40,I have a lot of respect &amp; admiration for Ms. G because she focuses on kids that people don't care about or have given up on. #Cesar911
444692940162482176,2014-03-15 04:33:53,LOL he just lied down on the rat! #Cesar911
444692868808982528,2014-03-15 04:33:36,Can we all agree that we think our dogs are the Brad Pitt of dogs? #Cesar911
444692830879903744,2014-03-15 04:33:27,Omg soo cute! I've never seen Beau as a puppy! Omg look at Ms. G back then! #Cesar911
444692719462391808,2014-03-15 04:33:00,I love that Ms. G gives kids a voice. I hope one day I can achieve the same thing by giving dog(s) a voice. #Cesar911
444691510861115392,2014-03-15 04:28:12,How do I look? With my hoodie on and my Pit Bull right next to me. Waiting to be profiled by Beau. #Cesar911
444691476790775809,2014-03-15 04:28:04,Gotta get #JuniorMillan to bring my A-game. #Cesar911
444691289859043328,2014-03-15 04:27:20,The hoodie thing is so interesting. #Cesar911
444691069561602048,2014-03-15 04:26:27,OMG. I mean that's so bad when a dog feels that he is entitled to jump up on the table and take your food. Yikes. #Cesar911
444691029824782336,2014-03-15 04:26:18,So gross! #Cesar911
444690972778049536,2014-03-15 04:26:04,But but I've never seen a Labrador that big! #Cesar911
444690938816778241,2014-03-15 04:25:56,"Beau is truly such a huge Labrador, I've never seen a Lab that big in my life! I've seen Mastiffs &amp; Rottweilers that have been bigger..."
444690715096780800,2014-03-15 04:25:03,Did you see the movie Freedom Writers about Ms. G and her students? #Cesar911
444690475048390656,2014-03-15 04:24:05,"Lol to Takis! He loves to ""spoon."" But who doesn't?! #Cesar911"
444690235025133568,2014-03-15 04:23:08,"Do you think ""You Know What!?"" will be the new ""Tsch!""? #Cesar911"
444690113931378689,2014-03-15 04:22:39,"That was it for Takis! His ""You know what"" in a strong tone is my ""Tsch!"" #Cesar911"

444689044945924096,2014-03-15 04:18:24,Do you think Takis and Joanne will get the Moos to stay in their beds? #Cesar911
444688844755959808,2014-03-15 04:17:37,"Lol to Takis, ""I think I passed the test."" #Cesar911"

444688400772128768,2014-03-15 04:15:51,Relax the arm! Great advice for dog walkers everywhere! #Cesar911
444688233088442368,2014-03-15 04:15:11,"Like I said, Mexicans and Greeks are pretty similar! Lol. #Cesar911"
444687987687698432,2014-03-15 04:14:12,Oh hi Junior and Alfie! #Cesar911
444687930934575104,2014-03-15 04:13:59,Always remember that your energy is transferred right through the leash! #Cesar911
444687852983431168,2014-03-15 04:13:40,At least Takis was willing to try to calm his own personal energy to help calm down the Moos. #Cesar911
444687718396592128,2014-03-15 04:13:08,"Lol, Takis' face is just so shocked that the Moos are calm. #Cesar911"
444687539689897984,2014-03-15 04:12:26,Did you see that? Everything was quiet until the Moos' came in. Then all the dogs went nuts. #Cesar911
444687493166661633,2014-03-15 04:12:14,"Hahah. The Moos ""Always"" look beautiful! #Cesar911"
444687085518086145,2014-03-15 04:10:37,What do you guys think of this week's #Cesar911 episode so far?

444686585049522176,2014-03-15 04:08:38,So sweet that Takis is willing to try. #Cesar911
444686408985231360,2014-03-15 04:07:56,"Greek people are very similar to Mexican people, the only difference is that we don't break plates. Lol. #Cesar911"
444686348926996480,2014-03-15 04:07:42,"Or instead of humanization, I should say the epitome of Greekinization of a dog. Lol. #Cesar911"
444686309622153217,2014-03-15 04:07:32,"I'm telling you, Takis was pretty bad! This is the epitome of humanizing a dog. #Cesar911"
444686208791101440,2014-03-15 04:07:08,"Nope, you're not acting normal Takis. Just so you know. Haha.. #Cesar911"

444685937457385473,2014-03-15 04:06:04,"Every second, she was taking pictures of me, lol. I can't even imagine how many pictures she has of her kids. #Cesar911"
444685886060392448,2014-03-15 04:05:51,"A funny thing about Joanne is that she takes SO many photos! Nobody has ever taken so many photos of me, I think she has a library.#Cesar911"
444685842678681600,2014-03-15 04:05:41,I couldn't believe he baptized the dogs Greek Orthodox. #Cesar911
444685705172635648,2014-03-15 04:05:08,"Joanne is a doll! And that hair, the Greeks love that big hair! #Cesar911"
444685657621803008,2014-03-15 04:04:57,"You know, when I hear someone with an accent I feel at home. It's like, I don't have to worry or feel insecure about my accent. #Cesar911"
444685634574114816,2014-03-15 04:04:51,"I was happy that although this is the first time I'd met Takis, he hugged me. It was welcoming in a way. #Cesar911"
444685294516715520,2014-03-15 04:03:30,"If you study my body language, look at my eyes, my expression, you can tell I was not ready for this! I honestly was not ready. #Cesar911"
444685256692494336,2014-03-15 04:03:21,"It's hard for me to see this scene where Takis' dogs are ABSOLUTELY out of control and he's just like ""nothing's wrong."" #Cesar911"
444685176782585856,2014-03-15 04:03:02,The 50's diner vibe was so well kept at Frisco's - It's like going back in time! And the food is incredible. #Cesar911
444685110088970240,2014-03-15 04:02:46,But my outfits are never planned to match the set or anything. I just put on my regular clothes. Just so you guys know! #Cesar911
444685066849902593,2014-03-15 04:02:36,My crew always says I must've known the right color to wear to match the cast or the background of the shoot. #Cesar911
444685026379063296,2014-03-15 04:02:26,It's funny because everybody that has worked with me always asks me how I knew what people were gonna wear when shooting. #Cesar911
