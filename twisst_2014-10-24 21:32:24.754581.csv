241565162933452800,2012-08-31 15:56:37,I have sent a reply and we'll see. Thanks again for your all your great support (#saveTwisst)! I'll try to blog tomorrow to answer all faqs.
241564641912819712,2012-08-31 15:54:33,"Anyway, doesn't look good. ""Right now the 1:1 communication aspect of your service is not scalable."""

241564192375721984,2012-08-31 15:52:46,Got a friendly email from Twitter. It says the problem is that the sender accounts are tweeting users who are not following those accounts.

241159068973162497,2012-08-30 13:02:57,I will try to see if there is another way to avoid being suspended all the time. I'll write a blog on it to explain further in a few days.
241158004341366786,2012-08-30 12:58:43,Thanks for your kind response. @Twitter thinks I am too spam-like. They're getting more strict about how we all may use their service.

25992319871,2010-09-30 15:56:49,@scibuff because most people leave the timezone at the default.
25991518405,2010-09-30 15:47:38,"@scibuff true, but we get new followers often & many people update their location regularly. then we have to geocode & find timezone again."

25990512887,2010-09-30 15:36:27,"@scibuff I'm sure they are good, but it would be cool if we could calculate it ourselves.mainly because it would cut our data traffic a lot."

2844217269,2009-07-25 22:55:10,"@willingthrall you got a nice one coming up on the 27th, high and bright. hope you will catch it!"
2844187771,2009-07-25 22:52:49,"@TaviGreiner lol no, but we have been thinking about getting puppets of ourselves :-) we are: http://www.twisst.nl/about-us and I'm @tjaap"
2844143117,2009-07-25 22:49:18,"@richard_m_dodd funny, have been wondering why every1 talks about personalised content, instead of making it happen. what appl do you see?"
2844070385,2009-07-25 22:43:33,@Chris_M_Ward that is requested often! I hope to have time to make it so in the coming week. thanks!
2844006110,2009-07-25 22:38:28,"@Ed ah yes, that should help ;-) also see http://twisst.nl/location. Thanks for the feedback!"
2836989702,2009-07-25 13:18:13,@Ed what do you think would be a good time to receive them in advance?
2836920441,2009-07-25 13:10:47,"@creuzerm yes, we plan to make the tweets a bit more descriptive in a few weeks"
2816240692,2009-07-24 10:17:15,@CosmicMalika I see this has been corrected already. ISS won't fly over Rotterdam until end of August though.
2816218883,2009-07-24 10:14:39,@tishnyc enter your location in your twitter profile to get ISS alerts for that location. see here: http://twisst.nl/location
2801962894,2009-07-23 17:31:48,@PeterRitchie @mortennorby just unfollow me if you don't want to receive alerts anymore. alerts will stop in a few days (will speed that up)
2781312540,2009-07-22 17:16:44,@elspode you're welcome!
2775228136,2009-07-22 09:21:16,"@Ed hi, your next pass will be July 22, 2009, 21:20:44 EDT and the day after that 21:44:58. for a longer period, check heavens-above.com."
2760730526,2009-07-21 16:44:50,@bartfuzzle sure. only need to follow (or unfollow) @twisst though - the rest is just accounts I use to send the tweets.
2755205223,2009-07-21 09:10:09,"@SissyWillis hi, only solution is to change the location in your profile a bit, like 'Chelsea, MA, USA'. pls see http://twisst.nl/location"

2736393960,2009-07-20 09:47:57,"@AlexConnor hi, thanks for letting me know. it is correct now."
2736303670,2009-07-20 09:35:37,@stefanversleeuw @BuienRadarNL zou daar graag aan meewerken! nog een fijn idee: verwachting voor bewolking verwerken in twisst-alerts.
2735996657,2009-07-20 08:56:11,"@jamerz3294 hi, that's probably a delay in the Twitter system, we seem to have sent it on time. let me know if your alerts are often late."
2728625607,2009-07-19 22:43:09,"@EvertB local time, unless the system has not yet figured out in which timezone you are. Until then it uses UTC. You'll see it on our site."
2728250899,2009-07-19 22:13:50,@samuels ISS travels at 7.7 kilometers per hour. See the Facts and Figures section on twisst.nl for more (by @goverttweets)
2724150892,2009-07-19 16:59:11,"@Starrfop you'll be able to see it again from the 25th of July, with a very good pass on the 28th."
2723187528,2009-07-19 15:40:42,@thenasaman cool! what is it you have up there?
2719938025,2009-07-19 09:04:43,"@appmeiphone @adagio28 @iTravisG just follow @twisst with a existing location in your profile, and you will get alerts for that location"
2708267428,2009-07-18 16:43:20,"@ve7shn we are working on grouping alerts, so you will get 1 alert per night. if it's too much, just unfollow me and alerts will stop."

2671740064,2009-07-16 16:19:36,"@mlanger ah I see, your timezone has not yet been found so your alerts are in UTC. please allow me to invite you back once I fix that!"
2667884779,2009-07-16 10:58:09,@mlanger sorry to hear that! I hope you'll want to try us again sometime.
2659125931,2009-07-15 22:29:52,@arjens1 @patrickneville Twisst updates your location about every day. but alerts won't be all that different if you only move a few miles.
2659081684,2009-07-15 22:26:49,@NEZTOK it may be that ISS just won't pass at your location the coming weeks. see our website for more about that.
2659032897,2009-07-15 22:23:28,"@hevpuggles @stefanversleeuw @astuifbergen glad you liked it, and glad I could help!"

2658980655,2009-07-15 22:19:58,@sacketrb you're welcome ;-) I will see if I can fix your timezone in the coming week.
2658946906,2009-07-15 22:17:40,@rob_son @yvertier @fokko_muller pretty cool eh? :-)
2658932537,2009-07-15 22:16:43,@BrechjevanBeek @Wijs leuk! laat maar weten waar ze online komen te staan

2630688908,2009-07-14 11:19:19,"Twitter suggested a solution to send lots of tweets. it may take a few more days, but then everyone will get alerts to all good ISS passes!"
2629850581,2009-07-14 09:27:51,@pahles lovely to see it go through Ursa Major like that!
2621733932,2009-07-13 22:28:24,@DrLucyRogers me too! too much city light here to see Progress. GoSatWatch on my iPhone already mentioned a shuttle being up there :-/
2621403729,2009-07-13 22:06:14,"@DrLucyRogers Twitter handed us a solution however, so that should be solved in the course of this week!"
2621385493,2009-07-13 22:05:05,"@DrLucyRogers maybe the first one was not bright enough to be visible? also, currently we don't have the capacity to send out all tweets."
2615597022,2009-07-13 15:35:28,@JeroenWeitering yes I will work something like that out too. but I'm still hoping Twitter will soon allow me to send more tweets!
2615573640,2009-07-13 15:33:55,"@stephenpruitt @MarkusRieder hmm that may just work! but I would have to make it an option. most found DMs annoying, that's why I changed it"
2612201019,2009-07-13 10:12:36,"@pahles cool, looking forward to those pics!"
2611977445,2009-07-13 09:40:46,what you saw chasing the ISS is Russian cargoship Progress @kejames see http://tinyurl.com/l3xbgu (great pic!) and http://tinyurl.com/9q9q3
2611805905,2009-07-13 09:16:12,I can't send all the alerts because of Twitters update limit. I just sent them a renewed request to allow us more updates. @BrechjevanBeek
2611776786,2009-07-13 09:12:02,"@DrLucyRogers great! I'm looking forward to tonight's pass, that will be very bright too."
2611682348,2009-07-13 08:58:53,@rs_txflygirl I get a kick of reading about Twisst in Russian :-) thanks!
2611663195,2009-07-13 08:56:10,great ground shot of ISS! RT @NewburyAS http://www.twitpic.com/9l83p [love the comments under it about tennis and the moon as banana :-]
2556994195,2009-07-09 21:24:16,"@frankwettert danke! Jedem kann ich jetzt leider noch nicht sagen, warte auf Twitter mehr Tweets senden zu dürfen.Hoffe das kommt schnell!"
2547987023,2009-07-09 09:31:38,@angsuman @stephenpruitt solved. it should not mention anything there when it has not yet found new passes for your location.
2547888163,2009-07-09 09:17:41,"@stephenpruitt thanks, I'll check it out."
2523638793,2009-07-08 00:04:00,@sciencecomedian hahaha great stuff. looks like a lot of fun indeed!
2523246376,2009-07-07 23:35:18,@sciencecomedian that's what I meant! must be fun to see a group looking up in middle of city centre. must have looked like a flash mob :-)
2523126248,2009-07-07 23:26:33,"RT @sciencecomedian: Last night, in midst of SF city lights, showed large group the ISS passing overhead [aweseome! any pictures?]"

2522381337,2009-07-07 22:33:05,"@mlanger lol! I've had many people telling me how they watched ISS with their family thanks to Twisst, so social networking it is! :-)"
2522358903,2009-07-07 22:31:27,"@mlanger every time I talk to you, my to do list grows :-)"
2522333821,2009-07-07 22:29:47,@Angel007 what a shame! why? clouds? or was it passing too low to see? see heavens-above.com if you want to check alerts are correct
2522271699,2009-07-07 22:25:14,"@mlanger great suggestion, one for the to do list. problem is right now I dont't have the time to make it, but it could be very usefull."
2521390335,2009-07-07 21:21:58,"@thenasaman if you want to know passes for two weeks in advance, you'll probably like www.heavens-above.com"
2521242121,2009-07-07 21:11:26,"@redhatman yes. good that they have these measures, but hopefully they will consider us harmless and let us through :)"
2521048967,2009-07-07 20:58:03,"I'm hoping Twitter will allow Twisst more than the 1K updates we can send now. thanks for waiting, let's hope they'll give us our ISS party!"
2520991064,2009-07-07 20:54:03,we're in kind of the same spot as last week: Twitter is limiting the number of tweets we send. some of you did not receive any alerts yet.
2517425216,2009-07-07 17:33:22,@jasohill I hope in the future to be able to consider cloud cover in the alerts. so you won't get one when you can't see it anyway :)
2516859662,2009-07-07 16:58:56,"@cbtw because of Twitters limits, we may not get all alerts out in time before each pass. I sent them an e-mail asking for a higher limit."
2516656638,2009-07-07 16:46:21,@cbtw that tweet was sent 13 hours ago so that was a previous pass. the website is now mentioning the upcoming pas for your location.
2513678389,2009-07-07 13:17:37,"@2pt7K @jemeenthet I used this account to send alerts temporarily, to try avoid Twitter's update limit. over now, sorry for inconvenience."
