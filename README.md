# botally-toolkit

A chaotic good bunch of Python scripts for collecting data about Twitter bot accounts.

## How to use

Seeing as I just spent the best part of an hour figuring out how to run these scripts again after re-downloading the Github file

- 

You'll need to make a file in the root folder called .env and it should look like this (except with your app's keys and tokens in the quotation marks):

	# some env variables

	TWITTER_API_KEY="yourAPIkeyappearslikethis"
	TWITTER_API_SECRET="itisimportantthatyoutrynottocommityourkeystoGitHub"
	TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="11111111-donotgiveyourTwittertokensawaytostrangers"
	TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="7Gaail1CI8bjQF6MbQzf6lpzlKQUJ7o6fi58dtUFhhJaM"



## Todo
