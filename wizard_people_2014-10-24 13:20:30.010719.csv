525451852343934976,2014-10-24 01:00:58,"Yes, they were sort of wrong about Snake."
525436754183344128,2014-10-24 00:00:59,"Chapter 15 Outside, Harry's class awaits their first lesson in broomstickers."
525421654907047937,2014-10-23 23:00:59,"'Fifty points deducted for each of you! It is forbidden to be out at night. All of you have detention, even you, Mouthoil!'"
525406552694726657,2014-10-23 22:00:58,She's putting a spell on Harry! Ahh! Something must be done! Ronnie the Bear curses that Snake a good one as Harmony creeps away.
525391454383128577,2014-10-23 21:00:58,"A bar? Hagar the Horrible, you'd better know what you're getting Harry into. Of course, the barkeep knows Hagar's bar-darkening frame."
525361254987493376,2014-10-23 19:00:58,The game is tied at
525346154515791874,2014-10-23 18:00:58,"The potions class's door is thrown dramatically open, and in dances that black hole of a woman, with a scar-aching glare."
525331056657195008,2014-10-23 17:00:58,"But lo-ho-ho, dear readers! It is a cloak, a cloak indeed, a cloak with a cloaking device! An Invisibility Cloak!"
525315956554629120,2014-10-23 16:00:58,'You will be schooled here.'
525300858750529536,2014-10-23 15:00:59,"Wood is the captain of the Cribbage team, and Harry sees him as a Greek statue, an Adonis in witches' clothing."
525285756152320001,2014-10-23 14:00:58,"'I was in here, crying like an idiot, and these badass new gods came in and saved me."
525270658226610177,2014-10-23 13:00:58,"Chapter 25 Later that night, Dazzler leads the four kids out to their duty of detention."
525255559264862208,2014-10-23 12:00:58,"You are meant to end when your share of that blood turns brown upon the rocks of glory! You and I shall drink to-night, Harry."
525240459854352384,2014-10-23 11:00:58,"'Ah, fuck this', he says, and he all but punches Mouthoil right in the head."
525225361316261888,2014-10-23 10:00:59,The food service wench appears.
525210262140641281,2014-10-23 09:00:59,'Woo-hoo!' shouts Harry. 'About time he burst that Cheeto! He's been trying to birth it for years! Hm hm hm!'
525195164193931265,2014-10-23 08:00:59,Snake is seemingly on the edge of her seat.
525180062417821696,2014-10-23 07:00:58,"'Well, we fucking go to school here.'"
525164959853211649,2014-10-23 06:00:58,"After the story's confusing conclusion, who should appear in the window but that fucking panda cub Mouthoil! After his fucking ass!"
525149863319973888,2014-10-23 05:00:58,"Hagar, after a while of tracking, kneels down and knowingly dips his finger into a shimmery pool of unicorn urine."
525134763792035840,2014-10-23 04:00:58,"If you have hair here, it is going to get rustled awesomely."
525119663983038464,2014-10-23 03:00:58,Does it know that it can live on the sustenance of such a warrior for years and not need worry about eating or drinking?
525104565272993792,2014-10-23 02:00:58,"P., he chickens out and vanishes, leaving Harry alone to deal with this shade."
525089463920508928,2014-10-23 01:00:58,'Willikers! The broom I wanted way back in Calgon Alley! The Necrobenimbloalaphasagoso! Who could have done this?'
525074365327888384,2014-10-23 00:00:58,"'This is really weird, man', he says, and Hagar nods, like he knows what a tiggle feels like."
525059265078497280,2014-10-22 23:00:58,Christmas morning.
525044164564893696,2014-10-22 22:00:58,Harry just hopes he can pound a few cold ones.
525029067280908288,2014-10-22 21:00:58,'I am Harry Fucking Potter!'
525013968826671104,2014-10-22 20:00:59,"If it wasn't for them, I'd be in that troll's stomach, for sure."
524983768508276737,2014-10-22 18:00:58,to Harry's aid jumps a badass man-horse who is kicking and threatening wildly at this prince of blood-lovers.
524968667856273409,2014-10-22 17:00:58,"Chapter 6 'I'm broke, Hagar. What do I do? I want that broom back there.'"
524953570328997888,2014-10-22 16:00:58,All these fucking kids and teachers looking at him like he's a fucking television!
524938471035924480,2014-10-22 15:00:59,Yes! The universe sighs its magical sigh.
524923369712803840,2014-10-22 14:00:58,"She says, 'Are you going home for Christmas? I'm going home. My family's got money.'"
524908271208267776,2014-10-22 13:00:58,"Chapter 30 As Harry walks down into his fate, he comes to realise that this is the moment beyond games, the moment he has been waiting for."
524893172598845440,2014-10-22 12:00:59,"The air, then, miraculously, becomes thinner, and Harry's forehead aches."
524878069807726592,2014-10-22 11:00:58,"She seems to think that Ronnie can't do a simple Levitation Spell, and makes a big to-do about her quick-witted abilities."
524862970929876992,2014-10-22 10:00:58,He holds up that Snitch and bellows:
524847874296012803,2014-10-22 09:00:59,"But Jeepers! Ed Vanders rushes into Harry's view like a scarecrow's carcass, a dreadful visage, indeed."
524832774336032768,2014-10-22 08:00:58,"Upfish, in a foolishly loving gesture, tries to keep our heroes from tasting victory to-night."
524817674724188160,2014-10-22 07:00:58,"Harry thinks that he will come back next year, and, when he does, Hagar will be there waiting, as long as God doesn't fuck anything up."
524802574445449216,2014-10-22 06:00:58,"'Catch this ball, Harry, and we win the game.' Harry's face explodes in a smile. This orb seems plucked from under Midas's tunic."
524787474460319744,2014-10-22 05:00:58,"Clearly, sidekicking for Hagar would suck balls. Hagar can't contain it anymore, and just drops his secret: 'You're a wizard, Harry!"
524772376744329217,2014-10-22 04:00:59,"But, now, who but the brave Ronnie the Bear whips out the old Levitation Spell and hovers the troll's club overhead?"
524757275572195328,2014-10-22 03:00:58,He is only half-aware of his uncle's battle with the birds.
524742176136515586,2014-10-22 02:00:58,"He gives up on using his words and tries to communicate with only his eyes. Oh, how they bulge and struggle to convey unthinkable meaning!"
524727075971031040,2014-10-22 01:00:58,"Ron replies, 'At least I'm not a hideous fucker.'"
524711977776857088,2014-10-22 00:00:58,"Soon, they are riding to the vaults on a roller-coaster."
524696877191921665,2014-10-21 23:00:58,"Harry's dad's face begins to move, like a marmalade baby just out of the womb."
524681780721623040,2014-10-21 22:00:59,"Viacom, well, this year Viacom has earned 480 points."
524666680342228993,2014-10-21 21:00:59,"The air, then, miraculously, becomes thinner, and Harry's forehead aches."
524636480694935553,2014-10-21 19:00:58,"Harry, from the bag, displays a sick-looking, out-of-fashion cloak. Ron jokingly demands that Harry has to model it."
524621379875131392,2014-10-21 18:00:58,No false moves here.
524606280775004161,2014-10-21 17:00:58,"A staring match ensues. And, of course, Harry is the victor."
524591181221883906,2014-10-21 16:00:58,Harry nods.
524576080376905728,2014-10-21 15:00:58,"'You got an account up in there, Master Harry.'"
524560981247401984,2014-10-21 14:00:58,"'Valmart is the name of the scar-maker', he whispers."
524545885771153408,2014-10-21 13:00:59,But our wolf remains cool.
524530781608476673,2014-10-21 12:00:58,"The snake has no parents, is dangerous, and is beautiful. Harry sees himself here, in this snake, like looking at his image in the mirror."
524515685926727680,2014-10-21 11:00:59,"She is truly a great wizard, also, and possesses many a skill that might aid in to-night's random errands."
524500586184843264,2014-10-21 10:00:59,'I guess I'll see you.'
524485483381161984,2014-10-21 09:00:58,"The Snitch then begins a clockwork striptease, and takes it into the air. It licks and beckons lasciviously on the wind. Harry is at home."
524470383937073152,2014-10-21 08:00:58,"Tears mix in with the sobby throw-up, and Hagar offers to call detention off early under the circumstances."
524455286485315584,2014-10-21 07:00:58,A music of brotherhood and balls.
524440188454699010,2014-10-21 06:00:59,Breathe into your sleeve for God's sake! Harry backs away just in time.
524425085537759232,2014-10-21 05:00:58,"Again with the face, again with the eyes."
524409989918912513,2014-10-21 04:00:59,Ronnie is sure that the hat will bear down on him and hunch away at his scalp for nothing.
524394889757609984,2014-10-21 03:00:59,"Harry, now bored and tired, brandishes again, but Kabloomers! Destrucci√≥n!"
524379789931843584,2014-10-21 02:00:59,Report cards are being altered as we speak.
524364689179148288,2014-10-21 01:00:58,'Hello?
524349590066458624,2014-10-21 00:00:58,"Hagar, after a while of tracking, kneels down and knowingly dips his finger into a shimmery pool of unicorn urine."
524334492123934720,2014-10-20 23:00:59,"But as Harry gazes, the mirror activates his magic eye to reveal a secret image."
524319390888493057,2014-10-20 22:00:58,Now on to yet another vault.
524304293159911424,2014-10-20 21:00:59,'Behold!' she manages out of her horrible mouth. 'Your dad was also a badass.'
524289190884683776,2014-10-20 20:00:58,"Before him, down the darkest of stairs and into the cellar, standing before the Gate of Heaven, why, it isn't Snake at all! It's Queerman!"
524274091885596672,2014-10-20 19:00:58,"Yes to life, and Yes to magic!"
524258993385242624,2014-10-20 18:00:58,There are sweaty corns and honeyed everything. Talking bones loosen and Harry relaxes into a wine-ish swagger.
524243892397694976,2014-10-20 17:00:58,He is mad with the satanic desire to win at any cost.
524228792831967232,2014-10-20 16:00:58,The ominous fog makes the night-time even more hoary and mysterious than usual here in suburban Britannia.

524183496227840000,2014-10-20 13:00:59,The game is finally over.
524168394346860545,2014-10-20 12:00:58,"The kids climb stair after stair, ad infinitum. Some talk about art, others simply concentrate on not vomiting from the intense vertigo."
524153298010791936,2014-10-20 11:00:59,"The house, under drifts of letters, molting, and bird shit, now pushes the uncle to burn anything that is represented on paper."
524138196691857408,2014-10-20 10:00:58,They both laugh and hold their bellies like two Santas on opposite ends of the scales.
524123096434081792,2014-10-20 09:00:58,"'Say, Ron, you look tired. Have you ever been tested for diseases?'"

521873276055089152,2014-10-14 04:00:59,Welcome to Calgon Alley.
521858174073458688,2014-10-14 03:00:59,The game is finally over.

521782675221524480,2014-10-13 22:00:58,"But, to Harry's surprise, neither shows up. Only Near-Dead Dumbledore stumbles upon the vigil."
521767576352088064,2014-10-13 21:00:58,"You know it's sweet stuff, man! Just take it!' And he moves himself into formation and out into danger."
521752479856599041,2014-10-13 20:00:59,'This is the moment!
521737379699511297,2014-10-13 19:00:59,'I am Harry Fucking Potter!'
521722278703562752,2014-10-13 18:00:59,Harry and Mouthoil are teamed up together.
521707178491936768,2014-10-13 17:00:58,"Chapter 30 As Harry walks down into his fate, he comes to realise that this is the moment beyond games, the moment he has been waiting for."
521691826701742081,2014-10-13 15:59:58,"'Put your hand in there, boy!'"
521676728193024000,2014-10-13 14:59:58,"And Ronnie the Bear, Ronnie the Bear quakes and is felled. Chunks of his horse spray-paint Harry and Harmony. She almost goes to Ron."
521661631370379264,2014-10-13 13:59:59,Christmastime snowiness flakes the castle gently.
521646530802225153,2014-10-13 12:59:59,Hagar had to summon the young detectives to get this off his chest.
521631432230580224,2014-10-13 11:59:59,"He puts on his lucky headband and pops his knuckles. And all the while, Queerman seems to be conversing wildly with the air."
521616332031537152,2014-10-13 10:59:59,"Upfish, in a foolishly loving gesture, tries to keep our heroes from tasting victory to-night."
521601231815729153,2014-10-13 09:59:59,"' The applause begins to increase, as if they know who is to be honoured next and they are just getting ready."
521586132719783936,2014-10-13 08:59:59,"They hug awkwardly and talk a bit about next year's problems, whatever they may be."
521571031677681664,2014-10-13 07:59:58,"'His stockpiles of nuclear-level energy will be funny and tricky to funnel', thinks Ed Vanders."
521555931650592769,2014-10-13 06:59:58,"comes out of his reverie, he is amazed to see that his friend Upfish has had some sort of serious accident."
521540835431956480,2014-10-13 05:59:59,But hello! Her usefulness again shows through as she decides to take Harry and Ronnie to the trophy case of honours.
521525733295132672,2014-10-13 04:59:58,The scene is so beautiful that the landscape is literally peppered with painters working out masterpiece after masterpiece.
521510636963258368,2014-10-13 03:59:59,"As Snake takes her leave, Harry turns to his brother and sister in arms and declares, 'I will feel her blood on my hands to-night!'"

521480435785031680,2014-10-13 01:59:59,"A gorilla or a bear, whatever, anything. Anything but you.' Ed Vanders, wasteland of a face, crowds in close. His monologue is stinky."
521465337943179264,2014-10-13 00:59:59,"After the story's confusing conclusion, who should appear in the window but that fucking panda cub Mouthoil! After his fucking ass!"
521450238603964416,2014-10-12 23:59:59,"Hagar seems put off and distant, sullen. His dragon baby has clearly run away with his heart."
521435136077078528,2014-10-12 22:59:58,"The other people take the rest, the south and the west. Harry and Mouthoil talk of nothing."
521420039761985537,2014-10-12 21:59:59,"Harry almost sobs, but moves on. He is a true champion."
521404939068014592,2014-10-12 20:59:59,"The kids, having nothing else to do to-night, their potions mixed, histories read, frogs destroyed, they decide to follow fate's lead."
521389840878030848,2014-10-12 19:59:59,Hagar had to summon the young detectives to get this off his chest.
521374738237882369,2014-10-12 18:59:58,"'A week ago I finally birthed this egg. Apparently I am the mother of a dragon. Now kids, don't tell anybody."
521344542579384320,2014-10-12 16:59:59,The stacks of gold coins in his pockets ease his worry.
521329439809224706,2014-10-12 15:59:58,Now on to yet another vault.
521314342072238080,2014-10-12 14:59:59,'Willikers! The broom I wanted way back in Calgon Alley! The Necrobenimbloalaphasagoso! Who could have done this?'
521299242665922561,2014-10-12 13:59:59,"A spell is cast, and Harry is forced to walk all jerky-style right up to look into the dreadful threshold of Heaven."
521284143603515392,2014-10-12 12:59:59,The murmurs begin.
521269043232522240,2014-10-12 11:59:59,"Harry, through a cloud of wizard magic and stealthily-pinched Valium from the evil aunt, notices his uncle fraying."
521253945772343296,2014-10-12 10:59:59,And just in time.
521238842003980288,2014-10-12 09:59:58,"Now pay attention, dear readers."
521208644495753216,2014-10-12 07:59:59,Harry backs away just in time.
521193545966034945,2014-10-12 06:59:59,"Ron, Ron loves Twizzlers. They talk over the syllabus and what's to be demanded of them at Hogwarts."
521178447683796992,2014-10-12 05:59:59,"At long last, Harry is in real time with his destiny. He cries out, 'I am important and unavoidable!'"
521163347958726656,2014-10-12 04:59:59,"Ronnie the Bear Weasel, you are bravery, you are courage, you are chess. One thousand points!"
521148247109566464,2014-10-12 03:59:59,"She then asks a lizard-hugging, stuttery professor Queerman if she can see the student known as Major Wood."
521133146268774400,2014-10-12 02:59:58,P. for who he is.
521118047575494656,2014-10-12 01:59:59,"You are a special boy. You don't know it, but you and I go way back."
521102947389018112,2014-10-12 00:59:58,"Thoughts of Slip 'n Slides and water-balloon wars are impossible to avoid. If you have hair here, it is going to get rustled awesomely."
521087847961743360,2014-10-11 23:59:58,Whoosh! He's just barely missing.
521072749734023168,2014-10-11 22:59:59,A music of brotherhood and balls.
521057648457027584,2014-10-11 21:59:58,"Chapter 7 Back on the shopping tour, and Harry needs a wand."
521042550145433600,2014-10-11 20:59:59,'Excuse me? Where's Platform 9 ¬æ?'
521027450890121216,2014-10-11 19:59:59,"'A week ago I finally birthed this egg. Apparently I am the mother of a dragon. Now kids, don't tell anybody."
521012352343609344,2014-10-11 18:59:59,But Harry cannot make it to his tiny door.
520997252966645760,2014-10-11 17:59:59,Chapter 18 Halloween! Yes!
520991729122832384,2014-10-11 17:38:02,Will Harry defy Professor Catface Meowmers for a chance to totally burn Mouthoil?
