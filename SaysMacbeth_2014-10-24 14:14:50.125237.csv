524726842419597312,2014-10-22 01:00:02,"Arm, arm, and out!"
524002072006782976,2014-10-20 01:00:04,"'Fear not, till Birnam wood do come to Dunsinane:' -- and now a wood comes toward Dunsinane."
523866142830759936,2014-10-19 15:59:56,"I pull in resolution, and begin to doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth..."
523730264938541056,2014-10-19 07:00:00,"If thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much."
523639672439062528,2014-10-19 01:00:01,"If thou speak'st false, upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive, till famine cling thee."
520015767644143616,2014-10-09 00:59:55,Liar and slave!
519879879396192256,2014-10-08 15:59:56,"Well, say, sir."
519743993941196800,2014-10-08 06:59:59,"It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
519653410795040769,2014-10-08 01:00:02,"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more."
518294473173127168,2014-10-04 07:00:06,"Out, out, brief candle!"
517841444909092864,2014-10-03 00:59:56,And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death.
517705564416405505,2014-10-02 15:59:59,"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time."
517569688260575232,2014-10-02 07:00:04,"She should have died hereafter, there would have been a time for such a word."
517479083115282432,2014-10-02 01:00:02,"I have supp'd full with horrors direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts cannot once start me."
517343189972578304,2014-10-01 16:00:02,My fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in't.
517207288017584130,2014-10-01 07:00:01,"The time has been, my senses would have cool'd to hear a night-shriek."
517116693672648705,2014-10-01 01:00:02,I have almost forgot the taste of fears!
515032966154960898,2014-09-25 07:00:02,"Were they not forced with those that should be ours, we might have met them dareful, beard to beard, and beat them backward home."
514444082576637952,2014-09-23 16:00:01,Here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up.
514081695814139904,2014-09-22 16:00:02,The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength will laugh a siege to scorn.
513130427960549376,2014-09-20 01:00:02,Hang out our banners on the outward walls.
512994533769240576,2014-09-19 16:00:02,"I will not be afraid of death and bane, till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane."
511544979928645632,2014-09-15 16:00:01,Bring it after me.
510457819938971650,2014-09-12 16:00:02,Hear'st thou of them?
507558714182623233,2014-09-04 16:00:02,"What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug, would scour these English hence?"
507422829395324929,2014-09-04 07:00:04,"Pull't off, I say."
506244996417482752,2014-09-01 00:59:47,"I would applaud thee to the very echo, that should applaud again."
506109113169104897,2014-08-31 15:59:50,"If thou couldst, doctor, cast the water of my land, find her disease, and purge it to a sound and pristine health."
505973233859170304,2014-08-31 06:59:54,"Come, sir, dispatch."
505882638197227520,2014-08-31 00:59:54,"Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me."
505746760212697088,2014-08-30 15:59:58,"Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff."
505610875534082048,2014-08-30 07:00:01,Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
502621086413258752,2014-08-22 00:59:39,With some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart.
502485204326682624,2014-08-21 15:59:43,Raze out the written troubles of the brain.
502349318956015616,2014-08-21 06:59:45,"Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased, pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow?"
502258730202071040,2014-08-21 00:59:47,Cure her of that.
502122848300048384,2014-08-20 15:59:50,"How does your patient, doctor?"
501986962971316224,2014-08-20 06:59:53,Give me mine armour.
501896376842989569,2014-08-20 00:59:55,"Send out more horses, skirr the country round, hang those that talk of fear."
501760489048002560,2014-08-19 15:59:57,Give me my armour. I'll put it on.
501624606781079552,2014-08-19 07:00:00,I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
501035733520764930,2014-08-17 16:00:02,What news more?
500673330597625856,2014-08-16 15:59:58,Take thy face hence.
500537448058068992,2014-08-16 07:00:01,"What soldiers, whey-face?"
500446857664143360,2014-08-16 01:00:03,Those linen cheeks of thine are counsellors to fear.
497049462851010560,2014-08-06 16:00:01,"What soldiers, patch? Death of thy soul!"
496913572325511168,2014-08-06 07:00:02,"Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, thou lily-liver'd boy."
496907241812152323,2014-08-06 06:34:53,"Geese, villain!"
496025038970429440,2014-08-03 20:09:19,The mind I sway by and the heart I bear shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
489439334060150785,2014-07-16 16:00:05,"Then fly, false thanes, and mingle with the English epicures."
489303438484717569,2014-07-16 07:00:05,"'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman shall e'er have power upon thee.'"
489212848661209088,2014-07-16 01:00:06,The spirits that know all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus...
489076954255982595,2014-07-15 16:00:07,What's the boy Malcolm? Was he not born of woman?
488941049838989313,2014-07-15 07:00:05,"Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane, I cannot taint with fear."
488850456433549312,2014-07-15 01:00:05,Bring me no more reports; let them fly all.
488714558433796096,2014-07-14 16:00:05,"But no more sights! Where are these gentlemen? Come, bring me where they are."
488578672392032256,2014-07-14 07:00:07,No boasting like a fool; this deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
488488066315599874,2014-07-14 01:00:05,"His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls that trace him in his line."
488352170408804352,2014-07-13 16:00:05,The castle of Macduff I will surprise; seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword.
488216274858549248,2014-07-13 07:00:05,"And even now, to crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done."
488125683546079234,2014-07-13 01:00:06,From this moment the very firstlings of my heart shall be the firstlings of my hand.
487989781679177728,2014-07-12 16:00:05,The flighty purpose never is o'ertook unless the deed go with it.
487853886716121088,2014-07-12 07:00:05,"Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits!"
487763290601172992,2014-07-12 01:00:05,Fled to England!
487627400457355266,2014-07-11 16:00:06,I did hear the galloping of horse: who was't came by?
487491505787920386,2014-07-11 07:00:06,Infected be the air whereon they ride; and damn'd all those that trust them!
487400906111995904,2014-07-11 01:00:06,Came they not by you?
487265005713100803,2014-07-10 16:00:04,Saw you the weird sisters?
487129117490302977,2014-07-10 07:00:06,"Come in, without there!"
487038516468015104,2014-07-10 01:00:05,Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour stand aye accursed in the calendar!
486902620758347776,2014-07-09 16:00:05,"What, is this so?"
486766732652982272,2014-07-09 07:00:07,"For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me, and points at them for his."
486676125716713472,2014-07-09 01:00:05,"Now, I see, 'tis true!"
486540232339095553,2014-07-08 16:00:05,Some I see that two-fold balls and treble scepters carry: Horrible sight!
486404324734406656,2014-07-08 07:00:02,"And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass which shows me many more."
486313737943388160,2014-07-08 01:00:05,Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more!
486177841420050433,2014-07-07 16:00:04,"What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?"
486041941637750784,2014-07-07 07:00:03,"A fourth! Start, eyes!"
485951351222845440,2014-07-07 01:00:05,Filthy hags! Why do you show me this?
485827551009316864,2014-07-06 16:48:09,A third is like the former.
455510768553693186,2014-04-14 01:00:04,"Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair, thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first."
455374873984913408,2014-04-13 16:00:05,Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
455238977855840256,2014-04-13 07:00:04,Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
455148372765065216,2014-04-13 01:00:02,Let me know.
455012471967735808,2014-04-12 16:00:01,"Deny me this, and an eternal curse fall on you!"
454876591676350464,2014-04-12 07:00:05,I will be satisfied!
454786002721058817,2014-04-12 01:00:07,"Yet my heart throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever reign in this kingdom?"
454682680781578240,2014-04-11 18:09:33,"Our high-placed Macbeth shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath to time and mortal custom."
453200550994014208,2014-04-07 16:00:06,"Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood of Birnam rise"
449214268596957184,2014-03-27 16:00:02,Sweet bodements! Good!
449078376754458624,2014-03-27 07:00:03,"Who can impress the forest, bid the tree unfix his earth-bound root?"
448987774272557056,2014-03-27 01:00:01,That will never be
448851891116457984,2014-03-26 16:00:04,"What is this that rises like the issue of a king, and wears upon his baby-brow the round and top of sovereignty?"
448715987748024320,2014-03-26 07:00:02,"That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies, and sleep in spite of thunder."
448625390928400384,2014-03-26 01:00:02,"But yet I'll make assurance double sure, and take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;"
448489495600459777,2014-03-25 16:00:02,"Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?"
448353618391875584,2014-03-25 07:00:07,"Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee."
448263013804433408,2014-03-25 01:00:05,Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one word more.
448235949042843648,2014-03-24 23:12:32,"Tell me, thou unknown power, whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks."
442630890636595200,2014-03-09 12:00:02,Call 'em; let me see 'em.
442510094782038016,2014-03-09 04:00:02,Answer me to what I ask you.
442434592687923200,2014-03-08 23:00:01,"Though the treasure of nature's germens tumble all together, even till destruction sicken;"
442359100056150016,2014-03-08 18:00:02,Though palaces and pyramids do slope their heads to their foundations;
442283604308017152,2014-03-08 13:00:03,Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
442208098938138624,2014-03-08 08:00:01,Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
442147706970976257,2014-03-08 04:00:02,Though the yesty waves confound and swallow navigation up;
442072206835609600,2014-03-07 23:00:02,Though you untie the winds and let them fight against the churches;
441996708193779713,2014-03-07 18:00:01,"Howe'er you come to know it, answer me..."
441921207282057216,2014-03-07 13:00:00,"I conjure you, by that which you profess."
441845717779230720,2014-03-07 08:00:02,"How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags! What is't you do?"
441785318413312000,2014-03-07 04:00:02,We are yet but young in deed.
441709821658546177,2014-03-06 23:00:02,My strange and self-abuse is the initiate fear that wants hard use
441634324450787329,2014-03-06 18:00:02,"Come, we'll to sleep."
441558828769755138,2014-03-06 13:00:03,"Strange things I have in head, that will to hand; which must be acted ere they may be scann'd."
441483326847602688,2014-03-06 08:00:02,"I am in blood stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o'er"
441422931730509826,2014-03-06 04:00:02,"For mine own good, all causes shall give way"
441347431817441280,2014-03-05 23:00:02,"For now I am bent to know, by the worst means, the worst."
441271934655799296,2014-03-05 18:00:02,"I will tomorrow, and betimes I will, to the weird sisters: More shall they speak"
441196434772082688,2014-03-05 13:00:01,There's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee'd.
441120937744691200,2014-03-05 08:00:01,I hear it by the way; but I will send.
441060537657356288,2014-03-05 04:00:01,"How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person at our great bidding?"
440985041649147904,2014-03-04 23:00:01,What is the night?
440909544781144064,2014-03-04 18:00:01,Augurs and understood relations have by magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth the secret'st man of blood.
440834050861715457,2014-03-04 13:00:02,Stones have been known to move and trees to speak
440758549073784832,2014-03-04 08:00:01,"It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood"
440698151872102400,2014-03-04 04:00:01,"When now I think you can behold such sights, and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, when mine is blanched with fear."
440622657315147777,2014-03-03 23:00:02,You make me strange even to the disposition that I owe.
440547159243362305,2014-03-03 18:00:02,"Can such things be, and overcome us like a summer's cloud, without our special wonder?"
440471677126733825,2014-03-03 13:00:06,"Pray you, sit still."
440396179046543360,2014-03-03 08:00:05,"Why, so: being gone, I am a man again."
439097610008133632,2014-02-27 18:00:02,"Hence, horrible shadow! Unreal mockery, hence!"
439022123223240704,2014-02-27 13:00:05,"If trembling I inhabit then, protest me the baby of a girl."
438946613738758145,2014-02-27 08:00:02,"Or be alive again, and dare me to the desert with thy sword;"
438886216616771584,2014-02-27 04:00:02,"Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves shall never tremble."
438810717567733761,2014-02-26 23:00:02,"What man dare, I dare: Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, the arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger."
438735238835884032,2014-02-26 18:00:06,"Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold, thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with!"
438659732333531136,2014-02-26 13:00:04,Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
438584227185971200,2014-02-26 08:00:02,"Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst, and all to all."
438523832320552960,2014-02-26 04:00:03,"I drink to the general joy o' the whole table, and to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss."
438448326673825792,2014-02-25 23:00:01,Give me some wine; fill full.
438372832062341120,2014-02-25 18:00:02,"Come, love and health to all, then I'll sit down."
438297344648282112,2014-02-25 13:00:04,"I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing to those that know me."
438221840926789632,2014-02-25 08:00:03,"Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends."
438161441657323524,2014-02-25 04:00:02,I do forget.
438085942486650880,2014-02-24 23:00:02,This is more strange than such a murder is.
438010442149920768,2014-02-24 18:00:01,"But now they rise again, with twenty mortal murders on their crowns, and push us from our stools."
437934957512499201,2014-02-24 13:00:04,"Too terrible for the ear: the times have been, that, when the brains were out, the man would die, and there an end."
437859450381037568,2014-02-24 08:00:02,"Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd"
437799047668060160,2014-02-24 04:00:01,"Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time, 'ere human statute purged the gentle weal."
437723553496956931,2014-02-23 23:00:02,"If I stand here, I saw him."
437648057606221824,2014-02-23 18:00:02,"If charnel-houses and our graves must send those that we bury back, our monuments shall be the maws of kites."
437572572368994305,2014-02-23 13:00:05,"Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too."
437497058270793728,2014-02-23 08:00:01,"Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo! How say you?"
437436666156818434,2014-02-23 04:00:03,"Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that which might appal the devil."
437361169754357760,2014-02-22 23:00:03,Thou canst not say I did it: never shake thy gory locks at me.
437285670755643392,2014-02-22 18:00:02,Which of you have done this?
437210180942446592,2014-02-22 13:00:04,The table's full.
437134676591792128,2014-02-22 08:00:03,Who may I rather challenge for unkindness than pity for mischance!
437074281936076801,2014-02-22 04:00:03,"Here had we now our country's honour roof'd, were the graced person of our Banquo present."
436998771981832193,2014-02-21 23:00:00,"Now, good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both!"
436923275193507840,2014-02-21 18:00:01,Sweet remembrancer!
436847791977934849,2014-02-21 13:00:04,"Get thee gone: tomorrow we'll hear, ourselves, again."
436772286557716480,2014-02-21 08:00:02,"There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled hath nature that in time will venom breed, no teeth for the present."
436711886659149825,2014-02-21 04:00:02,Thanks for that.
436636386842529792,2014-02-20 23:00:01,But Banquo's safe?
436560890897256449,2014-02-20 18:00:01,"But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in to saucy doubts and fears."
436485409351020545,2014-02-20 13:00:05,"Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect, whole as the marble, founded as the rock, as broad and general as the casing air"
436409895647068160,2014-02-20 08:00:01,"That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil."
436349500978765824,2014-02-20 04:00:02,Yet he's good
436273996208680960,2014-02-19 23:00:00,Thou art the best o' the cut-throats
436198500099837952,2014-02-19 18:00:01,Is he dispatch'd?
436123013814046720,2014-02-19 13:00:03,'Tis better thee without than he within.
436047513519263744,2014-02-19 08:00:03,There's blood on thy face.
435987114526638080,2014-02-19 04:00:03,Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure the table round.
435911615272062976,2014-02-18 23:00:02,Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst.
435836120220200960,2014-02-18 18:00:03,"See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks."
435760628033003521,2014-02-18 13:00:04,"Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time we will require her welcome."
435685124215029761,2014-02-18 08:00:02,"Ourself will mingle with society, and play the humble host."
435624722793897984,2014-02-18 04:00:02,You know your own degrees; sit down: at first and last the hearty welcome.
435549229960790016,2014-02-17 23:00:03,"So, prithee, go with me."
435473727631794176,2014-02-17 18:00:02,Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still; things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
435398240976896000,2014-02-17 13:00:04,Good things of day begin to droop and drowse while night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
435322735225344000,2014-02-17 08:00:02,Light thickens and the crow makes wing to the rooky wood.
435262333355429888,2014-02-17 04:00:01,And with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale!
435186839930949632,2014-02-16 23:00:02,"Come, seeling night, scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day."
435111344623210496,2014-02-16 18:00:03,"Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, till thou applaud the deed."
435035858823938049,2014-02-16 13:00:05,"The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done a deed of dreadful note."
434960348454461440,2014-02-16 08:00:02,"His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons"
434899948170006528,2014-02-16 04:00:02,Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown.
434824449678786560,2014-02-15 23:00:02,They are assailable.
434748955264446465,2014-02-15 18:00:02,There's comfort yet.
434673461936410624,2014-02-15 13:00:03,"Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives."
434597960647585792,2014-02-15 08:00:02,"O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!"
434537567430529024,2014-02-15 04:00:04,"Make our faces vizards to our hearts, disguising what they are."
434462061125316608,2014-02-14 23:00:01,"Unsafe the while, that we must lave our honours in these flattering streams."
434386567184908288,2014-02-14 18:00:02,"Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue."
434311083000467456,2014-02-14 13:00:05,Let your remembrance apply to Banquo.
434235571955716097,2014-02-14 08:00:02,"So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you."
434175174930231296,2014-02-14 04:00:02,"Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison, malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing, can touch him further."
434099676036333570,2014-02-13 23:00:02,After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.
434024172700721152,2014-02-13 18:00:01,Duncan is in his grave.
433948691754270720,2014-02-13 13:00:05,"Better be with the dead, whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy."
433873182924103681,2014-02-13 08:00:02,Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly:
433812787723124736,2014-02-13 04:00:03,"But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer"
433737286304292864,2014-02-12 23:00:02,"She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth."
433661790770040832,2014-02-12 18:00:02,"We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:"
433586305184698368,2014-02-12 13:00:05,"It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight, if it find heaven, must find it out to-night."
433510793770831872,2014-02-12 08:00:02,I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
433450401778511872,2014-02-12 04:00:03,Resolve yourselves apart: I'll come to you anon.
433374897373315072,2014-02-11 23:00:01,Must embrace the fate of that dark hour.
433299401243492352,2014-02-11 18:00:02,"Fleance his son, that keeps him company, whose absence is no less material to me than is his father's"
433223915435880448,2014-02-11 13:00:05,And with him-- to leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
433148408543469568,2014-02-11 08:00:02,And something from the palace; always thought that I require a clearness
433088010653949952,2014-02-11 04:00:02,For't must be done tonight.
433012511701340161,2014-02-10 23:00:02,"Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time, the moment on't."
432937008600588288,2014-02-10 18:00:01,Within this hour at most I will advise you where to plant yourselves.
432861526798499841,2014-02-10 13:00:04,Your spirits shine through you.
432786015351099392,2014-02-10 08:00:01,"And thence it is that I to your assistance do make love, masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons."
432725623253909505,2014-02-10 04:00:02,"For certain friends that are both his and mine, whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall who I myself struck down"
432650125828030464,2014-02-09 23:00:02,"Though I could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it, yet I must not."
432574624254009344,2014-02-09 18:00:01,"So is he mine; and in such bloody distance, that every minute of his being thrusts against my near'st of life"
432499139960512512,2014-02-09 13:00:05,Both of you know Banquo was your enemy.
432423627833614336,2014-02-09 08:00:01,"Who wear our health but sickly in his life, which in his death were perfect."
432363239121227776,2014-02-09 04:00:03,"Whose execution takes your enemy off, grapples you to the heart and love of us."
432287731041853440,2014-02-08 23:00:01,I will put that business in your bosoms.
432212235868733440,2014-02-08 18:00:01,"Now, if you have a station in the file, not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't"
432136754179489792,2014-02-08 13:00:05,Whereby he does receive particular addition from the bill that writes them all alike: and so of men.
432061243377991680,2014-02-08 08:00:02,Every one according to the gift which bounteous nature hath in him closed.
432000849896693760,2014-02-08 04:00:03,"The valued file distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, the housekeeper, the hunter"
431925347991302145,2014-02-07 23:00:02,"As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept all by the name of dogs"
431849850427035649,2014-02-07 18:00:02,"Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;"
431774364753620992,2014-02-07 13:00:05,"Are you so gospell'd to pray for this good man and for his issue, whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave and beggar'd yours for ever?"
431698854677725184,2014-02-07 08:00:02,Do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go?
431638453936082944,2014-02-07 04:00:01,"I did so, and went further, which is now our point of second meeting."
431562955629420546,2014-02-06 23:00:01,All things else that might to half a soul and to a notion crazed say 'Thus did Banquo.'
431487461269577728,2014-02-06 18:00:02,"How cross'd, the instruments, who wrought with them"
431411972790157312,2014-02-06 13:00:04,"In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you how you were borne in hand."
431336467776811008,2014-02-06 08:00:02,This I made good to you.
431276068633595905,2014-02-06 04:00:02,"Know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune, which you thought had been our innocent self."
431200575858827267,2014-02-05 23:00:03,"Well then, now have you consider'd of my speeches?"
431125078562988032,2014-02-05 18:00:03,Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
431049585209790464,2014-02-05 13:00:04,"Now go to the door, and stay there till we call."
430974075029028864,2014-02-05 08:00:01,Who's there!
430913686811598848,2014-02-05 04:00:03,And champion me to the utterance!
430838187645100033,2014-02-04 23:00:03,"Rather than so, come fate into the list."
430762684074565632,2014-02-04 18:00:01,"To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!"
430687193997139968,2014-02-04 13:00:03,"Given to the common enemy of man,"
430611692813180928,2014-02-04 08:00:02,Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
430551294730702848,2014-02-04 04:00:02,Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
430475799750123520,2014-02-03 23:00:03,For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd
430400295760191488,2014-02-03 18:00:01,"If 't be so, for Banquo's issue have I filed my mind"
430324815975559169,2014-02-03 13:00:05,"Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand, no son of mine succeeding."
430249307992637440,2014-02-03 08:00:03,"Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown, and put a barren sceptre in my gripe"
430188909557850112,2014-02-03 04:00:03,Then prophet-like they hail'd him father to a line of kings.
430113411347673088,2014-02-02 23:00:03,He chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him.
430037910357041152,2014-02-02 18:00:02,"And, under him, my Genius is rebuked; as, it is said, Mark Antony's was by Caesar."
429962419037696000,2014-02-02 13:00:03,There is none but he whose being I do fear.
429886912677961728,2014-02-02 08:00:01,"And, to that dauntless temper of his mind, he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety."
429826521831075840,2014-02-02 04:00:03,In his royalty of nature reigns that which would be fear'd
429751020772524032,2014-02-01 23:00:02,Our fears in Banquo stick deep
429675528493088768,2014-02-01 18:00:03,To be thus is nothing; but to be safely thus.
429600028231884800,2014-02-01 13:00:02,Bring them before us.
429524529656758272,2014-02-01 08:00:02,Our pleasure?
429464133176528899,2014-02-01 04:00:03,"Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men."
429388637373882368,2014-01-31 23:00:03,"The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!"
429313135204241408,2014-01-31 18:00:02,Let every man be master of his time till seven at night: to make society
429237638768242688,2014-01-31 13:00:02,Farewell.
429162138448318465,2014-01-31 08:00:01,"I wish your horses swift and sure of foot, and so I do commend you to their backs."
429101745608736768,2014-01-31 04:00:03,Goes Fleance with you?
429026245855027201,2014-01-30 23:00:02,Hie you to horse: adieu till you return at night.
428950746252333056,2014-01-30 18:00:02,"Filling their hearers with strange invention: but of that tomorrow, hen therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly."
428875246926442496,2014-01-30 13:00:01,"We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd in England and in Ireland, not confessing their cruel parricide"
428799763798958081,2014-01-30 08:00:05,Fail not our feast.
428739363145408512,2014-01-30 04:00:04,Is't far you ride?
428663863735635969,2014-01-29 23:00:03,"We should have else desired your good advice, which still hath been both grave &amp; prosperous, in this day's council; but we'll take tomorrow"
428588367446437888,2014-01-29 18:00:04,Ride you this afternoon?
428512871547281408,2014-01-29 13:00:04,"To-night we hold a solemn supper sir, and I'll request your presence."
428437380580667392,2014-01-29 08:00:06,Here's our chief guest.
428376972977115137,2014-01-29 04:00:03,"Let's briefly put on manly readiness, and meet i' the hall together."
428301475257667584,2014-01-28 23:00:03,"Who could refrain, that had a heart to love, and in that heart courage to make's love known?"
428225973624918016,2014-01-28 18:00:02,"There, the murderers, steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers unmannerly breech'd with gore."
428150483702661120,2014-01-28 13:00:04,His gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature for ruin's wasteful entrance.
428074987925172224,2014-01-28 08:00:05,"Here lay Duncan, his silver skin laced with his golden blood."
428014588282413056,2014-01-28 04:00:04,"The expedition my violent love outrun the pauser, reason."
427939090361630720,2014-01-27 23:00:04,"Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious, loyal and neutral, in a moment?"
427863593632030720,2014-01-27 18:00:04,"O, yet I do repent me of my fury, that I did kill them."
427788092720693248,2014-01-27 13:00:03,The very source of it is stopp'd.
427712599099064320,2014-01-27 08:00:04,"You are, and do not know't; the spring, the head, the fountain of your blood is stopp'd."
427652204074237952,2014-01-27 04:00:05,"The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees is left this vault to brag of."
427576700528910336,2014-01-26 23:00:04,Renown and grace is dead.
427501194731192320,2014-01-26 18:00:02,All is but toys.
427425709280096256,2014-01-26 13:00:04,"From this instant, there's nothing serious in mortality."
427350203838898176,2014-01-26 08:00:03,"Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had lived a blessed time."
427289813390065664,2014-01-26 04:00:04,What is 't you say? the life?
427214313489563649,2014-01-25 23:00:04,What's the matter.
427138817078726656,2014-01-25 18:00:04,'Twas a rough night.
427063327265542145,2014-01-25 13:00:06,"He does, he did appoint so."
426987824412254208,2014-01-25 08:00:05,The labour we delight in physics pain.
426927424543014912,2014-01-25 04:00:04,I'll bring you to him.
426851932984995840,2014-01-24 23:00:06,"Good morrow, both."
426776431759065090,2014-01-24 18:00:05,Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
426700933825720321,2014-01-24 13:00:05,"To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself."
426625442200563713,2014-01-24 08:00:06,"No, this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas in incarnadine, making the green one red."
426565034718683136,2014-01-24 04:00:04,Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand?
426489549091381248,2014-01-23 23:00:06,What hands are here? Ha! They pluck out mine eyes!
426414038390554625,2014-01-23 18:00:03,"How is't with me, when every noise appals me?"
426338543015710720,2014-01-23 13:00:04,Whence is that knocking?
426263047317901312,2014-01-23 08:00:04,Look on't again I dare not.
426202646563655680,2014-01-23 04:00:04,I am afraid to think what I have done.
426127152614875137,2014-01-22 23:00:04,I'll go no more.
426051651539976192,2014-01-22 18:00:04,Macbeth shall sleep no more.
425976153229123584,2014-01-22 13:00:03,"Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more"
425900661239054337,2014-01-22 08:00:05,Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house.
425840259583062016,2014-01-22 04:00:04,"The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath, balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast"
425764761700032513,2014-01-21 23:00:04,"The innocent sleep, sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care."
425689268258746368,2014-01-21 18:00:05,Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more! Macbeth does murder sleep'
425613767561338881,2014-01-21 13:00:04,"But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'? I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen' stuck in my throat."
425538275097325568,2014-01-21 08:00:05,"Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,' when they did say 'God bless us!'"
425477873181261824,2014-01-21 04:00:04,"One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other, as they had seen me with these hangman's hands."
425402372790026240,2014-01-20 23:00:03,Again to sleep.
425326868581994497,2014-01-20 18:00:02,"That they did wake each other, I stood and heard them, but they did say their prayers, and address'd them."
425251381092446208,2014-01-20 13:00:04,"There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried 'Murder!'"
425175885163925504,2014-01-20 08:00:05,This is a sorry sight.
425115485412155392,2014-01-20 04:00:04,Hark! Who lies i' the second chamber?
425039985331281922,2014-01-19 23:00:04,When? As I descended?
424964478791196672,2014-01-19 18:00:01,Didst thou not hear a noise?
424888988432736256,2014-01-19 13:00:03,I have done the deed.
424813507062689792,2014-01-19 08:00:07,"Who's there? what, ho!"
424753095424217089,2014-01-19 04:00:04,"Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell."
424677599600586752,2014-01-18 23:00:04,The bell invites me.
424602092511059968,2014-01-18 18:00:02,"I go, and it is done."
424526604941799424,2014-01-18 13:00:04,Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
424451116684697600,2014-01-18 08:00:06,"Whiles I threat, he lives."
424390708426854400,2014-01-18 04:00:04,"Take the present horror from the time, which now suits with it."
424315208647983105,2014-01-17 23:00:03,"Thou sure and firm-set earth, hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout"
424239703642996737,2014-01-17 18:00:02,"With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design moves like a ghost"
424164219542437888,2014-01-17 13:00:05,"Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace"
424088721445486593,2014-01-17 08:00:05,"Witchcraft celebrates pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder, alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf"
424028317503598592,2014-01-17 04:00:03,"Now o'er the one halfworld nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse the curtain'd sleep."
423952824494354432,2014-01-16 23:00:04,There's no such thing: It is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes.
423877326691004416,2014-01-16 18:00:04,"I see thee still, and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, which was not so before."
423801825876119552,2014-01-16 13:00:03,"Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses, or else worth all the rest"
423726336427827200,2014-01-16 08:00:05,Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going; and such an instrument I was to use.
423665929981947904,2014-01-16 04:00:03,"I see thee yet, in form as palpable as this which now I draw."
423590438608461824,2014-01-15 23:00:05,"Or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?"
423514941228732417,2014-01-15 18:00:05,"Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight?"
423439439801483264,2014-01-15 13:00:04,"I have thee not, and yet I see thee still."
423363955487014913,2014-01-15 08:00:07,"Is this a dagger which I see before me, the handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee."
423303544687435779,2014-01-15 04:00:04,Get thee to bed.
423228044900200448,2014-01-14 23:00:03,"Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready, she strike upon the bell"
423152541182865408,2014-01-14 18:00:02,Good repose the while!
423077049058598912,2014-01-14 13:00:03,"If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis, it shall make honour for you."
423001560830844928,2014-01-14 08:00:05,"Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, we would spend it in some words upon that business, if you would grant the time."
422941161741746176,2014-01-14 04:00:05,I think not of them!
422865662172622848,2014-01-13 23:00:05,"Being unprepared, our will became the servant to defect; which else should free have wrought."
422790163282939905,2014-01-13 18:00:04,A friend.
422714664930127872,2014-01-13 13:00:04,False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
422639172747132928,2014-01-13 08:00:05,"Away, and mock the time with fairest show."
422578776145293312,2014-01-13 04:00:06,Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
422503273908555776,2014-01-12 23:00:04,"I am settled, and bend up"
422427775597690880,2014-01-12 18:00:04,"Those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers, that they have done't?"
422424935584129025,2014-01-12 17:48:47,"Will it not be received, when we have mark'd with blood"
422216390477488129,2014-01-12 04:00:06,Bring forth men-children only; for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males.
422140887045390336,2014-01-11 23:00:05,If we should fail?
422065374444523520,2014-01-11 18:00:01,I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none.
421989890595635200,2014-01-11 13:00:04,"Prithee, peace"
421914393220108288,2014-01-11 08:00:04,"I have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people, which would be worn now in their newest gloss, not cast aside so soon"
421853989789892608,2014-01-11 04:00:03,He hath honour'd me of late
421778494243082240,2014-01-10 23:00:03,We will proceed no further in this business
421702998671097857,2014-01-10 18:00:04,Hath he ask'd for me?
421627503187214336,2014-01-10 13:00:04,"I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other"
421552012174430208,2014-01-10 08:00:06,"Heaven's cherubim, horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air, shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, that tears shall drown the wind"
421491610187096064,2014-01-10 04:00:05,"And pity, like a naked new-born babe, striding the blast"
421416106134237185,2014-01-09 23:00:03,"His virtues will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against the deep damnation of his taking-off"
421340606502146048,2014-01-09 18:00:03,"Besides, this Duncan hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been so clear in his great office"
421265114839269379,2014-01-09 13:00:04,"Then, as his host, who should against his murderer shut the door, not bear the knife myself"
421189628587016192,2014-01-09 08:00:07,"He's here in double trust; First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, strong both against the deed..."
421129216915030016,2014-01-09 04:00:04,This even-handed justice commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice to our own lips
421053717681434624,2014-01-08 23:00:03,"That we but teach bloody instructions, which, being taught, return to plague the inventor."
420978224198189056,2014-01-08 18:00:04,But in these cases we still have judgment here.
420902723987308544,2014-01-08 13:00:04,"But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, we'ld jump the life to come."
420827230164361217,2014-01-08 08:00:04,That but this blow might be the be-all and the end-all here.
420766831226257408,2014-01-08 04:00:04,"If the assassination could trammel up the consequence, and catch with his surcease success"
420691329778065409,2014-01-07 23:00:03,"If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly."
420615832742268928,2014-01-07 18:00:03,We will speak further.
420540335203172352,2014-01-07 13:00:03,"My dearest love, Duncan comes here to-night. Tomorrow, as he purposes."
420464844668559361,2014-01-07 08:00:05,"Stars, hide your fires, let not light see my black and deep desires"
420404442932846593,2014-01-07 04:00:04,"The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step on which I must fall down, or else o'erleap, for in my way it lies"
420328946433929216,2014-01-06 23:00:04,So humbly take my leave.
420253446478888960,2014-01-06 18:00:04,I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful the hearing of my wife with your approach
420177946330943490,2014-01-06 13:00:03,"The rest is labour, which is not used for you"
420102456454815745,2014-01-06 08:00:05,"Do but what they should, by doing every thing safe toward your love and honour"
420051294099742720,2014-01-06 04:36:47,Our duties are to your throne and state children and servants
419966564981420032,2014-01-05 23:00:06,Your highness' part is to receive our duties
419891053001322497,2014-01-05 18:00:02,"The service and the loyalty I owe, in doing it, pays itself"
419815559782342656,2014-01-05 13:00:03,"Till then, enough. Come, friends."
419740066261397505,2014-01-05 08:00:04,"Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time, the interim having weigh'd it, let us speak our free hearts each to other"
419679667117756416,2014-01-05 04:00:04,Let us toward the king
419604167095640064,2014-01-04 23:00:03,"Kind gentlemen, your pains are register'd where every day I turn the leaf to read them"
419528668004630528,2014-01-04 18:00:03,Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten
419453169282740225,2014-01-04 13:00:03,"Come what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day"
419377664860766208,2014-01-04 08:00:01,"If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me, without my stir"
419317269211004929,2014-01-04 04:00:02,Nothing is but what is not.
419241786905620480,2014-01-03 23:00:05,"If good, why do I yield to that suggestion"
419233027126870016,2014-01-03 22:25:17,Present fears are less than horrible imaginings.
419223630044610560,2014-01-03 21:47:56,"Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs, against the use of nature?"
418564871161008128,2014-01-02 02:10:16,"If good, why do I yield to that suggestion?"
418353598339104768,2014-01-01 12:10:45,I am thane of Cawdor.
418203242476994560,2014-01-01 02:13:17,"Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill, why hath it given me earnest of success, commencing in a truth?"
418195818680578048,2014-01-01 01:43:47,"I thank you, gentlemen."
418162062624178177,2013-12-31 23:29:39,Thanks for your pains.
418050072647987200,2013-12-31 16:04:38,"Glamis, and thane of Cawdor! The greatest is behind."
417959471134937088,2013-12-31 10:04:37,The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me in borrow'd robes?
417868864664264705,2013-12-31 04:04:35,And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
417778260915671040,2013-12-30 22:04:34,Your children shall be kings.
417687654843420672,2013-12-30 16:04:31,"Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted, As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!"
417597054131507200,2013-12-30 10:04:30,"With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you."
417506448306749442,2013-12-30 04:04:28,You owe this strange intelligence? or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
417417411604652032,2013-12-29 22:10:40,"Stands not within the prospect of belief, no more than to be Cawdor."
